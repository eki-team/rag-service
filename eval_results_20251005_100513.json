      "answer": "Microgravity exposure has significant effects on bone density in mice, particularly in the context of skeletal unloading and fluid redistribution. A study involving C57BL6 mice exposed to 15 days of microgravity during the STS-131 mission revealed that microgravity led to a statistically significant increase in bone volume (BV) in the calvariae of the spaceflight group compared to ground controls. The mean BV for the spaceflight group was 10.48 ± 0.47, while the ground control group had a mean BV of 9.64 ± 0.79, with a p-value indicating significance (p < 0.05) [1].\n\nAdditionally, while the cross-sectional thickness (CsTh) of the parietal bones showed a trend towards increase in the spaceflight group (0.104 ± 0.005 mm) compared to the ground control group (0.099 ± 0.006 mm), this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.12) [1]. Tissue mineral density (TMD) measurements were similar between both groups, indicating that while BV increased, TMD did not show a corresponding change [1].\n\nThe findings suggest that fluid shifts accompanying microgravity may initiate bone remodeling independent of mechanical loading, which is typically a significant factor in bone density maintenance [1]. Furthermore, the study hypothesized that reduced mechanostimulation of osteocytes in microgravity could lead to osteocytic osteolysis and activation of matrix degradation pathways, indicating a complex interaction between microgravity and bone metabolism [1]. \n\nOverall, while microgravity exposure resulted in increased bone volume in specific areas, the overall implications for bone density and health in a microgravity environment remain complex and warrant further investigation.",

          "text": "These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading by tissue. Keywords: bone, adaptation, space, microgravity Corresponding author. Bone remodeling may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the space flight (SF) group compared to the ground control (GC) group  the mean  SD for SF group was 10.48  0.47 , compared to 9.64  0.79  for GC group (p0.05).

          "text": "Finally, we also hypothesized that reduced mechanostimulation of osteocytes in microgravity may signal the activation of osteocytic osteolysis of lacunar surfaces, with accompanying activation of matrix degradation pathways. Our spaceflight results presented here, suggest that the bone degenerative effects of microgravity in skeletally mature mice go beyond rapid osteoclastic activation, affecting also cell cycle regulation in the osteogenic lineage, and inducing osteocytic osteolysis. All flight and ground control mice were observed to be in good condition by veterinary examination immediately post-landing. Noticeably, the posture of space-flown mouse tails after landing was vertical, indicating increased vestibular function in this group. The average weight loss of space-flown mice was 2.0 g (9.1, SD  2.1 g, p  0.013) significantly lower than pre-flight values, consistent with tissue atrophy in microgravity, while synchronous ground control mice only lost an average of 0.7 g (3.4, SD  0.9 g, p  0.096) of their body weight relative to the beginning of spaceflight. The difference in body weight loss averages for flight versus ground controls was not statistically significant (p  0.143). Flight habitats showed utilization of resources on average of 10 less food, and 24 less water than synchronous ground controls.",

      "answer": "Spaceflight has been shown to have harmful effects on astronauts, particularly in terms of immune system function. Research indicates that spaceflight leads to decreased immune system function, making astronauts more vulnerable to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions [2]. This weakened immune response is compounded by the fact that microorganisms can become more virulent in the space environment, presenting additional health challenges for crew members during long-term missions [2].\n\nRecent studies utilizing Drosophila and mouse models have demonstrated that spaceflight can suppress the innate immune system [3][4]. Specifically, investigations into the immune responses of Drosophila during spaceflight revealed that while hypergravity conditions improved resistance to certain fungal infections, spaceflight itself altered immune responses. Flies that developed in microgravity exhibited changes in transcription profiles, including activation of the heat shock stress system, but failed to activate the Toll pathway when infected by fungi [3]. In contrast, bacterial infections did not show this impairment, indicating a differential impact of spaceflight on immune signaling pathways [3].\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant, as the combined effects of decreased immune function in astronauts and increased virulence in bacteria could pose serious health risks during extended space missions. Moreover, the challenges posed by biofilms, which are known to exhibit increased resistance to environmental stress and host defenses, further complicate the situation. Biofilms have been associated with issues such as corrosion and blocked systems in spacecraft, which can exacerbate the health risks for astronauts [5][6][7][8]. Thus, understanding the effects of spaceflight on immune function is crucial for developing effective countermeasures to protect astronaut health during long-duration space exploration.",

The combined microgravitational effects of decreased immune function in space travelers and increased resistance and virulence in bacteria may be detrimental to the health of the crew during long-term space exploration. To date, spaceflight studies on bacterial behavior have been conducted using suspension cultures. However, such cultures do not typically represent real-world situations because the majority of bacteria in nature exist in surface-associated microbial communities known as biofilms. Bacteria in biofilms often exhibit increased resistance to environmental stress, antibiotics, and host defense systems [5]. Thus, many problems caused by biofilms such as biofouling, corrosion, and infectious diseases are difficult to control using conventional antimicrobial treatments [5], [6]. Indeed, abundant biofilms were found in the Russian Mir space station and were responsible for increased corrosion and a blocked water purification system [7]. Ground-based studies have indicated that corrosion caused by biofilms can be detrimental to materials that were used on the International Space Station and other spacecrafts [8].",

          "text": "Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system.",

      "answer": "During space missions, significant changes in gene expression occur, particularly related to frailty and circadian rhythms. RNA analysis has shown a global response of frailty-related gene expression to the space environment, characterized by both in-flight and post-flight expression changes. Most genes investigated exhibited alterations when compared to pre-flight conditions, either during spaceflight or after returning to Earth [1].\n\nFor instance, several genes that were reduced during spaceflight, such as AKT1, NOS2, FGF23, and HIF3A, showed an increase in expression after re-entry. Conversely, other genes, including TGFB1, B2M, NOS1, AOC1, SOD2, SOD3, and OAZ1, tended to be reduced during spaceflight and continued to decrease after re-entry [1]. This indicates a complex pattern of gene expression changes that may relate to the physiological stresses experienced during space missions.\n\nAdditionally, spaceflight-associated changes in circadian gene expression suggest that circadian disruption is a major biological response to spaceflight, although this has been comparatively little studied, especially in animal models [1]. The dysregulation of circadian gene expression may correlate with changes in synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammation, resembling neurodegeneration associated with natural aging [1]. \n\nOverall, the findings indicate that spaceflight induces significant alterations in gene expression, which may have implications for understanding the biological effects of long-duration space missions and potential countermeasures for astronauts' health [1].",

          "text": "Spaceflight-associated changes in circadian gene expression are consistent with circadian disruption as one of the major biological responses to spaceflight50, though it has been studied comparatively little so far, especially in animal models51. Molecular and cellular CNS correlation of circadian gene expression dysregulation in spaceflight remains to be investigated in greater detail. Our results suggest potential similarities between spaceflight and some terrestrial CNS conditions. Changes in gene expression associated with disrupted synaptogenesis and neurogenesis, oxidative stress and inflammation collectively resemble neurodegeneration that is associated with natural aging. Thus, in future studies anti-aging and neuroprotective therapeutics, such as antioxidants52 or mitochondria-targeting pharmaceuticals53,54, might be repurposed as spaceflight countermeasures, or vice versa, spaceflight might be used as a model for accelerated aging55. We have recently begun computational studies on identifying terrestrial disorder analogs to alterations induced by spaceflight, though they have not yet included CNS effects, which will require comparing the data from multiple spaceflight experiments56. Our study presents two main limitations. The first one is related to statistical robustness.",

      "answer": "Radiation exposure significantly affects plant growth in space by causing damage to cellular components and DNA. Specifically, plants exposed to radiation experience DNA lesions, which include single-stranded breaks, double-strand breaks (DSB), mismatches, and modified bases [1][3]. This damage triggers a DNA Damage Response (DDR) that can lead to various outcomes, including DNA repair, cell survival, or cell death [4]. \n\nThe model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, commonly used in spaceflight studies, demonstrates these effects clearly. Arabidopsis has a rapid life cycle of about six weeks and is well-suited for cultivation in restricted environments, making it an ideal candidate for studying the impacts of space conditions on plant biology [5]. Research has shown that similar to terrestrial stressors, spaceflight induces extensive changes in the transcriptional gene regulatory networks of Arabidopsis, which can provide insights into how plants adapt to the unique challenges of space [7].\n\nMoreover, the increased radiation exposure during spaceflight is expected to elicit a complex array of physiological and molecular responses in plants. These responses are not only a result of radiation but also involve the overall conditions of spaceflight, which are outside the evolutionary history of terrestrial organisms [1]. Understanding these responses is crucial, as plants play a vital role in life support systems for long-duration crewed missions and potential colonization efforts [9]. The analysis of omics datasets, such as those available in NASA's GeneLab data repository, allows researchers to investigate the changes in transcriptomes, proteomes, and other biological layers induced by spaceflight conditions, further elucidating the impact of radiation on plant growth [10][11].",

          "text": "Organisms in space are exposed to radiation, which affects the health of humans and the anatomy and growth of plants and animals [1]. Space missions have to deal with IR in current spacecraft and future long-term deep-space missions [2]. Plants are affected by radiation resulting in damage to cellular components and damage to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) [3]. Exposure to radiation causes DNA lesions in plant cells such as single-stranded breaks, Double Strand Breaks (DSB), mismatches, and modified bases. This leads to DNA Damage Response (DDR) that includes signal transduction, triggering either DNA repair, cell survival, or cell death [4]. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is a member of the mustard family widely used as a model organism in plant biology for studies of the cellular and molecular biology of flowering plants. It has a rapid life cycle of about six weeks from germination to mature plants. It can be easily cultivated in restricted space, has a small genome, a large number of mutant lines, extensive genetic maps, and genomic resources. Hence, it has been chosen as a model organism for spaceflight studies by research communities [5,6]. Similar to observations made on terrestrial plant stressors, spaceflight missions have made extensive observations and collected transcriptional gene regulatory datasets of Arabidopsis [7]. Plants have evolved genes that participate in DNA repair pathways that help the plant to survive the effects of radiation.",

          "text": "Additionally, the increased radiation exposure inherent in spaceflight is likely to trigger its own array of responses within the plant. The combination of these spaceflight-linked effects is outside the evolutionary history of terrestrial biology and so it remains complicated to predict the effects of spaceflight on organisms. Yet, understanding the molecular and physiological responses of plants to these conditions remains an important goal for space biologists, not the least because plants are integral to many plans for life support on long-duration crewed missions and for colonization9. One way to probe the responses of organisms to spaceflight is by analysis of changes in their transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, genomes and epigenomes induced by exposure to this environment. In the field of plant biology the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASAs) GeneLab data repository10,11 has aggregated many such omics datasets. Critically, the deposited data are associated with extensive metadata covering elements of each experiments design ranging from features of the hardware, radiation exposure and lighting regime to treatment duration, genotype and organism age. Such extensive and accurate metadata are critical to understanding the breadth of differences in experimental designs when making comparisons between studies. This insight is important as the flight hardware used, the analysis methodology employed (e.g.",

      "answer": "Microgravity exposure during spaceflight leads to significant muscle atrophy and weakness in skeletal muscle tissues. This atrophy is primarily attributed to altered mechanotransduction, oxidative stress, and impaired stress response, which collectively contribute to the remodeling of musculoskeletal tissue under conditions of mechanical unloading [1]. The identification of mechanosensing pathways during spaceflight is a key objective for NASA, as understanding these pathways is crucial for addressing the effects of microgravity on muscle morphology and contractile function [1].\n\nSkeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that adapt to changes in their mechanical environment. When subjected to decreased loading, such as in microgravity, these muscles undergo atrophy, while increased loading can lead to hypertrophy [1]. For instance, resistance exercise in humans can stimulate muscle hypertrophy, indicating that skeletal muscles can remodel their morphology in response to varying mechanical stimuli [1]. \n\nAdditionally, microgravity exposure may induce specific mitochondrial protein adaptations that affect skeletal muscle function. Changes in enzymatic activities, such as those of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase, have been observed, suggesting that mitochondrial bioenergetics in skeletal muscle respond differently compared to cardiac muscle under microgravity conditions [1]. This highlights the complexity of muscle responses to microgravity and underscores the need for comprehensive studies that include multiple tissues and time points to better understand the mechanisms of muscle decline associated with spaceflight [1]. \n\nOverall, the effects of microgravity on muscle atrophy are profound, leading to significant changes in muscle structure and function, which are critical considerations for astronaut health during long-duration space missions [1].",

Mounting evidence indicates that altered mechanotransduction, oxidative stress, and impaired stress response contribute to mechanical unloading-induced atrophy and remodeling of musculoskeletal tissue48. Therefore, the identification of mechanosensing pathways during the unloading of spaceflight, and thus the effect on musculoskeletal morphology and contractile function, continues as one of NASAs long-term mission objectives. Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that drive body movement, protect joints and bones, serve as the primary glucose sink, and are central to systemic energy metabolism. Skeletal muscles adapt readily to changes in various stimuli, including changes in loading9,10. Indeed, skeletal muscles remodel their morphology in response to changes in the mechanical, nutrient, and energy-sensing environments1115. Load-bearing skeletal muscles adapt to changes in the mechanical environment, allowing mature muscle fibers to hypertrophy in response to increased loading and atrophy when presented with decreased loading. For example, when humans participate in resistance exercise, skeletal muscles can undergo increased mass through hypertrophy of muscle fibers16,17.",

          "text": "The effect of microgravity exposure may cause specific mitochondrial protein adaptations that affect skeletal muscle tissue, namely 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, palmitate oxidation and cytochrome c oxidase enzymatic activity75,78,79. It is noteworthy that tissues might respond differently to microgravity and the mitochondrial bioenergetics adaptations seen in skeletal muscle may be different from the ones seen in cardiac muscle; however new sequencing data may provide an insight into these differences18,75. Thus, using data from multiple tissues and time points begins to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of frailty in response to spaceflight. Importantly, our results demonstrate that these approaches can be employed directly in astronauts andor in combination with model systems. Muscle decline is another conserved feature between spaceflight and aging. It is also thought to contribute to frailty. Recently, functional measures of muscle decline with age have been well correlated with evolutionarily conserved gene expression changes with age27,74. In humans, changes in metabolic gene expression appear to occur prior to changes in inflammatory gene expression, suggesting that aging human muscle undergoes metabolic remodeling prior to becoming inflamed and sarcopenicalso highlighting the importance of temporaldynamic data71.",

      "answer": "The environment of the International Space Station (ISS) significantly affects various cellular processes, particularly in stem cells and fibroblasts. Research indicates that microRNA dysregulation may have a pronounced impact on neonatal cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), which exhibit relatively higher levels of gene expression related to these processes. This dysregulation necessitates further elucidation of functional differences in CPCs for potential use in autologous cardiac stem cell therapies, especially in an adult population [1].\n\nMoreover, the ISS environment introduces unique stressors that are not present in terrestrial laboratory settings. These include the stress associated with rocket launches and the limited availability of astronauts for routine maintenance of cell cultures once aboard the ISS. Such conditions may influence stem cell processes, prompting future research to consider the effects of spaceflight-related stressors, such as sheer and vibrational forces, on cellular behavior under normal gravity conditions [1]. For instance, a study demonstrated that 2D clinorotation on Earth, which simulates microgravity, affected the developmental properties of CPCs similarly to actual spaceflight [1].\n\nIn addition to CPCs, other studies have shown that cell proliferation, motility, and cell-cell communication are also impacted in the ISS environment. Specific genes such as CSNK2A2, ITGAV, NRCAM, and NRP2 were downregulated, while RAB27b, associated with microvesicle formation, was significantly upregulated. Notably, there was a loss of stemness without evidence of apoptosis or senescence, alongside an upregulation of collagen genes and downregulation of matrix metallopeptidases [1]. Furthermore, research by Terada et al. revealed altered expression of genes linked to cell cycle disruption and hair growth in hair follicles collected from astronauts during a six-month mission on the ISS [1]. \n\nOverall, the ISS environment poses complex challenges that affect cellular processes, highlighting the need for continued investigation into the molecular adaptations of cells in space [1].",

          "text": "In the context of this experiment, microRNA dysregulation may have exerted a greater effect on neonatal CPCs given their relatively higher levels of expression of genes related to these processes. Nevertheless, the prospective use of CPCs in autologous cardiac stem cell therapies in a predominately adult population requires that these functional differences be elucidated. Although the ISS represents a truly unique opportunity to conduct life science research in space, there are several limitations that do not exist in the well-controlled laboratory environments on Earth. In addition to the stress associated with rocket launch, the limited availability of astronauts once aboard the ISS impacts the otherwise routine maintenance of cell cultures. For this reason, future research should consider the influence of various spaceflight-related stressors, such as sheer and vibrational stressors, on stem cell processes under normal gravity conditions. For example, we have shown that 2D clinorotation on Earth, which was performed in a carefully controlled laboratory setting, impacted the developmental properties of CPCs in a manner that was similar to spaceflight.27 As humans prepare to expand our presence in space, it is imperative to deepen our understanding of the nature of cellular adaptation to spaceflight so that we may develop mechanisms by which these molecular changes in cardiac cell types can be countered.",

      "answer": "During long-term spaceflight, astronauts experience significant cardiovascular changes primarily due to the effects of microgravity. These changes include fluid shifts from the lower limbs to the head, which lead to decreased circulatory blood volume and diminished diastolic arterial pressure. Additionally, there is a reduction in left ventricular dimensions and an increased risk of post-flight orthostatic intolerance [1]. \n\nThe structural and functional deconditioning of the vascular system is particularly notable in the carotid artery (CA) and femoral artery (FA). Studies have shown that after six months of spaceflight, there is increased arterial stiffness and reduced compliance in the CA, alongside an increase in intima-media thickness in both the CA and FA [2]. This vascular remodeling is thought to be influenced by various molecular regulators, including osteopontin, nuclear factor kappa B, and acid sphingomyelinase, although a comprehensive genetic and molecular explanation for these changes remains unclear [1][3][4][5].\n\nMoreover, research involving mice exposed to spaceflight for 15 days indicated alterations in the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways. Specifically, spaceflight was found to downregulate the transcription factor Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) and upregulate Nox1, suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress. Additionally, there was a significant upregulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis-related gene Cdkn1a (p21) and downregulation of the inflammatory response gene Tnf, indicating complex molecular changes that may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight [1]. \n\nOverall, the cardiovascular changes observed during long-term spaceflight are multifaceted, involving both physiological and molecular adaptations that can have lasting effects on astronauts' health.",

Spaceflight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body fluids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight. Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting 3 h post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight. Spaceflight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), upregulated Nox1 and downregulated Ptgs2, suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. Spaceflight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a (p21) and cell cycleapoptosis-related gene Myc, and downregulated the inflammatory response gene Tnf. There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53.",

      "answer": "Cosmic radiation significantly impacts DNA damage and repair mechanisms in human cells. Ionizing radiation, such as that from galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), can directly damage DNA by inducing single-strand and double-strand breaks. Double-strand DNA breaks, particularly those caused by high-energy hits, are particularly challenging for cells to repair. If these breaks are not properly repaired, they can lead to cell death or mutations, which may contribute to cancer and other diseases [3][13].\n\nThe nature of GCR includes heavier atomic nuclei with high linear energy transfer (high-LET) values, which pose a greater risk to human health compared to lower-LET radiation like X-rays. Research by Kennedy et al. demonstrated that exposure to high-LET 56Fe ions alters DNA methylation patterns, which can distinguish between normal tissues and certain types of lung cancers. These methylation changes were found to persist over time, indicating a heritable imprint across the epigenome [6][7]. This suggests that DNA methylation may serve as a sensitive biomarker for exposure to high-LET radiation.\n\nMoreover, the effects of cosmic radiation are compounded by the fact that it can also generate reactive free radicals through interactions with water molecules in cells. These free radicals can lead to further DNA damage and complicate the repair process. The cumulative impact of ionizing radiation during long-duration space missions raises concerns about an increased rate of carcinogenesis and other health issues, including cardiovascular diseases and central nervous system impairment [3][14]. While current data do not indicate an increased risk of gynecologic cancers in female astronauts, the potential for low-dose radiation to accumulate over time remains a significant concern for future exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit [15][17].",

          "text": "Subject terms: Computational biology and bioinformatics, Molecular biology, Space physics With a growing interest in space travel1, it is pivotal to better understand how galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) impacts human health and how its detrimental effect can be minimized2. Ionizing radiation damages DNA structure by inducing double-stranded breaks, single-stranded breaks, base damage and changing epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation patterns3,4. During long exposure, these alterations are likely to increase the risk of cancer and degenerative diseases occurrence5. Besides hydrogen and helium, GCR consists of heavier atomic nuclei with high linear energy transfer (high-LET) values which are of great danger for human health. Recently, Kennedy et al.6 investigated an effect of high-LET 56Fe, 28Si ions on DNA methylation patterns in comparison to low-LET X-ray appearing in terrestrial radiation. The researchers found that the methylation status of 56Fe irradiated CpG sites can distinguish normal tissue from lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell lung carcinomas. Additionally, the researchers showed acute radiation-induced methylation changes which persisted over time with heritable imprint across epigenome. These findings where further investigated by Nwanaji-Enwerem et al.7 showing that 56Fe exposure was associated with accelerations in epiTOC2 epigenetic clock suggesting that DNA methylation may be a sensitive biomarker of high-LET 56Fe ion exposure.",

          "text": "Ionizing radiation can impact the cells directly, where the particles impact a vital target molecule and directly transfer their energy, or indirectly, where particles impact other molecules, such as water, leading to longer lasting, very reactive free radicals. When impacting DNA, ionizing radiation can cause single-strand or double-strand DNA breaks. Double-strand DNA breaks, especially those caused by close single hits or high-energy hits, are much harder to repair. Non-rejoined breaks can lead to cell death, while incorrectly rejoined breaks can lead to mutation. Space radiation has a complex impact on human tissues and is an etiological agent for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system impairment, radiation sickness, and other harmful conditions [3,13]. The Earths magnetic field is a crucial protective element. Given the nature of ionizing space radiation, an increased rate of carcinogenesis is a primary concern for long-duration spaceflight [14]. While no increase in gynecologic cancer risk has yet been revealed in the female astronaut population [15,16], as exploration missions will be outside of low Earth orbit and for increasingly long durations, concern remains regarding the effects of even a low-dose rate accumulating over time [17]. The three main sources of ionizing space radiation are galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and the Van Allen radiation belt [18].",

      "answer": "The molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced immune dysregulation involve alterations in T-cell responses and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. A study utilizing adoptive transfer of T-cell receptor transgenic OT-II CD4 T cells demonstrated that spaceflight impaired the induction of immune tolerance. Specifically, the number of OT-II cells in flight mice treated with the cognate peptide ovalbumin (OVA) was significantly increased by two-fold compared to ground mice treated with OVA, indicating a disruption in the normal tolerance mechanisms [1].\n\nFurthermore, the study reported a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokines in flight mice. Notably, there was a five-fold increase in interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and a ten-fold increase in interleukin-17 (IL-17) production in the spaceflight cohort compared to ground controls. These findings suggest that spaceflight conditions may lead to excessive inflammatory responses, which could have implications for astronaut health during long-duration missions [1].\n\nOverall, the evidence indicates that spaceflight can lead to dysregulated immune responses characterized by impaired tolerance and heightened inflammation. However, further research is necessary to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and their potential impacts on astronaut health during extended missions in space [1].",

          "text": "Here, authors show region-specific spaceflight-induced alterations in processes of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission. In preparation for long-duration lunar and Mars missions, it is crucial to investigate the health risks to astronauts that are posed by exposure to the space environment1. The key physiological impairments include DNA damage and oxidative stress from galactic cosmic radiation2, bone and muscle damage from loss of gravity3,4, circadian and sleep dysregulation5, microbial dysbiosis6 and tissue and organ degeneration, including cardiovascular and CNS damage7. Studies on animal models have shown several spaceflight stressors directly impacting brain molecular mechanisms causing neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and neurovascular damage811. Specifically, exposure to simulated space radiation at doses comparable to the ones expected during the planned Mars mission, leads to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in vivo and in tissue and cell models12, as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits in rodent models. Furthermore, major physiological effects of microgravity in low-Earth orbit, as observed at the International Space Station (ISS), include a redistribution of body fluids from lower towards upper body parts, leading to significant cardiovascular13 and CNS changes14. However, deeper investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms and specificity of these impairments, and identify targets for countermeasure development.",

The health risks of a dysregulated immune response during spaceflight are important to understand as plans emerge for humans to embark on long-term space travel to Mars. In this first-of-its-kind study, we used adoptive transfer of T-cell receptor transgenic OT-II CD4 T cells to track an in vivo antigen-specific immune response that was induced during the course of spaceflight. Experimental mice destined for spaceflight and mice that remained on the ground received transferred OT-II cells and cognate peptide stimulation with ovalbumin (OVA) 323-339 plus the inflammatory adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A. Control mice in both flight and ground cohorts received monophosphoryl lipid A alone without additional OVA stimulation. Numbers of OT-II cells in flight mice treated with OVA were significantly increased by 2-fold compared with ground mice treated with OVA, suggesting that tolerance induction was impaired by spaceflight. Production of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in flight compared with ground mice, including a 5-fold increase in IFN-γ and a 10-fold increase in IL-17. This study is the first to show that immune tolerance may be impaired in spaceflight, leading to excessive inflammatory responses.Chang, T. T., Spurlock, S. M, Candelario, T. L. T., Grenon, S.

      "answer": "Microgravity influences stem cell differentiation by modulating critical pathways and altering the cellular environment, which can lead to both enhanced and suppressed differentiation depending on the specific conditions and cell types involved.\n\nIn microgravity, human mesenchymal stem cells typically exhibit suppressed differentiation, allowing them to retain their undifferentiated phenotypes. This phenomenon suggests that the absence of gravitational forces may help maintain the stem cells in a more primitive state, which could be advantageous for certain applications in regenerative medicine [1]. Conversely, other studies indicate that microgravity can enhance the differentiation of specific stem cell lineages. For instance, microgravity has been shown to improve stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages by modulating pathways such as Hippo and PI3K-Akt [1].\n\nThe effects of microgravity on stem cell behavior are complex and can vary significantly based on the type of stem cells and the specific experimental conditions. For example, while some studies report that microgravity conditions suppress differentiation [1], others highlight that microgravity can promote the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics [1]. This suggests that microgravity may provide a unique microenvironment that can influence stem cell behavior in ways that are not fully understood.\n\nOverall, the dual implications of microgravity for stem cell differentiation underscore its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, particularly in the context of developing functional cardiomyocytes for treating cardiac diseases [1]. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which microgravity affects stem cell differentiation and to optimize these conditions for therapeutic applications.",

Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health.

Notably, human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in a microgravity environment usually demonstrate suppressed differentiation [38]. Therefore, some highly functional stem cells may be able to retain their undifferentiated, unaltered phenotypes if they can avoid the force of gravity during culture. According to previous studies, controlled rotation around two axes can minimize the cumulative gravity vector to an average of 103 g over time [24]. In our experimental system, although cells were attached to microsphere surfaces, the culture medium containing the microspheres was stirred by controlled rotation around two axes. As a result, the cells gravity vectors were randomly and continuously changing, with their final cumulative gravity vectors being minimized toward zero. Some microgravity-simulating devices have been developed [39,40], but they involve significant costs and are very difficult to standardize. Moreover, even such devices created large cell clusters which represent the limit of cell-proliferative capacity [25] and reinforce the advantage of the present adhesive conditions for the large-scale expansion of hASCs [41].",

This comprehensive strategy aims to enhance our understanding of the neurological impacts of spaceflight and could also have implications for treating neurodegenerative diseases on Earth [1].\n\nFuture studies are essential to address these gaps in knowledge, particularly as space exploration objectives evolve to include longer missions to destinations beyond low Earth orbit, such as the Moon and Mars [1].

Such prolonged mission durations could introduce potential unprecedented astronauts health and performance risks. Adverse behavioral conditions and psychiatric disorders are considered one of the most serious but also least understood risks during such long-duration space missions. The effects of extreme environmental conditions and psychological stressors on brain and behavior are currently not fully understood. Future work in this field should be characterized by an interdisciplinary approach that promotes collaborations across space agencies, considers sex as a biological variable, and integrates multimodal brain imaging, psychological and behavioral, neurovestibular, cardiovascular, omics, sleep, and circadian data. Such an approach could promote a holistic understanding of intellectual frameworks that together exceed individual disciplinary perspectives. The knowledge from such approaches could go beyond their application to spaceflight and translate to the prevention and treatment of various clinical conditions on Earth including but not limited to neurogenerative diseases.

      "answer": "Weightlessness, or microgravity, significantly affects bone remodeling in astronauts, leading to a phenomenon known as bone loss. Studies indicate that astronauts experience variable bone loss that correlates with the length of their missions in space [2][3][4]. Specifically, weight-bearing bones, such as the femur, calcaneus, hip, spine, and neck, are particularly susceptible to this loss, losing more bone than non-weight-bearing bones [5]. This suggests that the unloading of skeletal structures in microgravity plays a crucial role in bone remodeling processes.\n\nResearch has shown that chronic unloading of weight-bearing bones results in an uncoupling of bone remodeling at the tissue level. In this state, the rates of bone resorption are elevated while the rates of bone formation remain largely unchanged, leading to overall bone loss and a weaker skeleton [34][57]. This uncoupling increases the risk of fractures among astronauts, as the correlation between bone loss and diminished bone strength is significant [8][9][10]. \n\nPhysiological studies from missions, such as those conducted on Skylab, have documented increasing levels of calcium and phosphate in the serum and urine of astronauts, indicating a gradual loss of bone mineral content during their time in space [6]. Some astronauts continue to lose bone even after returning to Earth, and those who experience the most significant bone decrements may not fully recover even after five years [7]. This prolonged effect underscores the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind bone remodeling in microgravity to mitigate risks associated with long-duration space missions. \n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that microgravity induces adaptive changes in calvarial bones that do not typically bear weight, indicating that fluid shifts alone may initiate bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading [1]. Thus, the effects of weightlessness on bone remodeling present a critical challenge for the health and safety of astronauts during extended space exploration.",

Weight-bearing bones such as the femur, calcaneus, hip, spine and neck lose more bone than non-weight-bearing bones [5], establishing the pivotal role of skeletal unloading on bone remodeling. Physiological studies of the Skylab missions document increasing calcium and phosphate levels in both serum and urine of crewmembers [6], reflecting a gradual loss of bone mineral content in these astronauts. Some of these crewmembers continue to lose bone after returning to Earth, and those who experience the greatest bone decrements do not fully recover even after five years [7]. The correlation between bone loss and diminishing bone strength suggests a significant risk of fractures for astronauts [8, 9, 10].",

      "answer": "In space-exposed organisms, particularly in plants, significant changes in gene expression have been observed as part of their physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Specifically, the expression of genes involved in cell wall remodeling, intracellular transport, and starch biosynthesis is altered, and these changes are dependent on proteins Arg1 and HsfA2 [1]. This suggests that these proteins play major and specific roles in the adaptation processes necessary for survival in microgravity conditions.\n\nResearch involving Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that exposure to different partial-g forces during parabolic flight and clinostat experiments leads to gravity-dependent alterations in gene expression. For instance, the least effects on gene expression were noted after 30 minutes at 0.5g, indicating that exposure time may have a more significant impact than the change in gravity itself [1]. This finding highlights the complexity of how plants respond to varying gravitational conditions, with a focus on the duration of exposure being critical for understanding gene expression changes.\n\nMoreover, while it is well established that plants exhibit significant changes in gene expression in response to the microgravity environment, studies on protein expression changes at a proteomic scale have been limited. The only comprehensive proteomic study to date involved a label-free analysis of membrane proteins from Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the International Space Station (ISS) [1]. This underscores the need for further research to explore the full extent of protein expression changes in space-exposed organisms, as current knowledge primarily focuses on gene expression rather than proteomic adaptations.",

          "text": "In addition, most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1- and HsfA2-dependent. Specifically, these genes were involved in cell wall remodeling, intracellular transport and starch biosynthesis, suggesting major and specific roles of these two proteins in the physiological spaceflight adaptation through these processes. Overall, this study showed up that the use of knockout lines greatly increases the list of genes that are necessary to adapt to and survive in the spaceflight environment. This amplifies the information that is necessary to learn on what biological processes are necessary and what genes are involved in these processes (Zupanska et al., 2017, 2019). Cell cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana were exposed to partial-g forces (0.16g, 0.38g and 0.5g) for different times during parabolic flight (24 s, 33 s and 20 s) and clinostat experiments (5 min, 10 min and 30 min), in order to investigate gravity-dependent alterations in gene expression by whole-genome microarray analysis (Fengler et al., 2016) (Table 5). The results revealed that, in simulation by clinorotation, the least effects (the lowest number of differentially expressed genes at least 2-fold) were obtained after 30 min at 0.5g. Furthermore, the hierarchical clustering (Pearsons Correlation Coefficient) suggested that, in the clinorotation experiment, gene expression was more affected by the exposure time than by the change in gravity, because 0.16g, 0.38g and 0.",

          "text": "Key Words: Space biologyProteomicsGene expressionISS. Astrobiology 15, 3256. Plants undergo substantial physiological adaptation to accommodate changing environments. As sessile organisms, plants have developed exquisitely sensitive metabolisms that can provide insights into how eukaryotes sense and respond to external stimuli. Spaceflight presents unique challenges to terrestrial organisms. The microgravity environment in itself is outside the evolutionary experience of any terrestrial organism, but the absence of gravity also impacts the physical environment inherent to the unique living space of orbital vehicles (Musgrave et al., 1997; Wolff et al., 2013). It is now well established that plants grown in orbital vehicles exhibit significant changes in gene expression as part of the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment (Link et al., 2001; Paul et al., 2001, 2005, 2012b, 2013; Stutte et al., 2006; Salmi and Roux, 2008; Salmi et al., 2011; Correll et al., 2013; Nasir et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2014). However, studies approaching plant adaptation to spaceflight at the level of the proteome have been limited. To date, the only true proteomic-scale study of plants in space has been a label-free analysis of membrane proteins isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the International Space Station (ISS) (Mazars et al., 2014).",

      "answer": "Microgravity exposure significantly impacts mitochondrial function, particularly in oligodendrocytes (OLs) and skeletal muscle tissues. Research indicates that simulated microgravity enhances mitochondrial function in OLs, which are crucial for myelin formation in the central nervous system [11]. Specifically, after just three days in microgravity, there is a notable decrease in glucose and pyruvate levels, while lactate levels increase considerably. This shift suggests that OLs switch to anaerobic glycolysis to meet their energy demands in a microgravity environment [11].\n\nIn skeletal muscle tissue, microgravity exposure leads to specific mitochondrial protein adaptations, including changes in 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, palmitate oxidation, and cytochrome c oxidase enzymatic activity [N]. These adaptations may differ across various tissues, indicating that the mitochondrial bioenergetics responses in skeletal muscle are not necessarily the same as those in cardiac muscle [N]. This variability highlights the complexity of how different tissues respond to microgravity and the need for comprehensive studies across multiple tissues and time points to understand the underlying mechanisms of frailty associated with spaceflight [N].\n\nFurthermore, the maintenance of energy metabolism homeostasis is critical for the overall health of cells in microgravity. It is suggested that neural stem cells (NSCs) may require increased energy for proliferation and homeostasis in the unique conditions of space, which include not only microgravity but also factors like radiation and varying g-forces during launch and re-entry [11]. Despite these challenges, NSCs appear to recover their stemness and maintain membrane properties similar to those grown under normal gravity conditions upon return to Earth [11]. This resilience underscores the importance of formulating energy-rich diets and providing enriched environments for astronauts to support their physiological and psychological well-being during space missions.",

          "text": "We have previously reported that simulated microgravity enhances mitochondrial function in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the CNS [11]. Two of the main sources of energy for respiration and energy production, glucose and pyruvate, were decreased after just 3 days in microgravity, while lactate levels increased considerably indicating that OLs switched to anaerobic glycolysis in order to meet the energy demands elicited by microgravity [11]. It is possible that NSCs in space require more energy for proliferation as well as for maintaining homeostasis in an environment where, besides microgravity, there are other factors involved, such as radiation, moving while being packed and unpacked, and variation of g-forces occurring during launching and splashdown. Nonetheless, the cells appeared to be able to recover from such a journey and display their stemness when returned to Earth. Furthermore, as mentioned above, their membrane properties were similar to the NSCs grown in normal gravity. Neurobiology and the environment determine psychological and physiological fitness and behavior; hence, the maintenance of energy metabolism homeostasis is of paramount importance. The formulation of energy rich diets for astronauts, as well as providing an enriched environment, may contribute to reaching and maintaining the balance we all strive formens sana in corpore sano (a healthy mind in a healthy body).",

          "text": "The effect of microgravity exposure may cause specific mitochondrial protein adaptations that affect skeletal muscle tissue, namely 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, palmitate oxidation and cytochrome c oxidase enzymatic activity75,78,79. It is noteworthy that tissues might respond differently to microgravity and the mitochondrial bioenergetics adaptations seen in skeletal muscle may be different from the ones seen in cardiac muscle; however new sequencing data may provide an insight into these differences18,75. Thus, using data from multiple tissues and time points begins to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of frailty in response to spaceflight. Importantly, our results demonstrate that these approaches can be employed directly in astronauts andor in combination with model systems. Muscle decline is another conserved feature between spaceflight and aging. It is also thought to contribute to frailty. Recently, functional measures of muscle decline with age have been well correlated with evolutionarily conserved gene expression changes with age27,74. In humans, changes in metabolic gene expression appear to occur prior to changes in inflammatory gene expression, suggesting that aging human muscle undergoes metabolic remodeling prior to becoming inflamed and sarcopenicalso highlighting the importance of temporaldynamic data71.",

      "answer": "Cosmic radiation has significant effects on circadian rhythms, primarily through its impact on cellular processes that regulate these rhythms. Specifically, radiation-induced DNA damage can lead to reduced levels of NAD, which is crucial for maintaining circadian rhythm systems. This reduction in NAD levels impairs the regulation of Sirt1, a protein that plays a vital role in the acetylation of BMAL, a core component of the circadian clock [2]. \n\nFurthermore, the alteration in mitochondrial protein production due to cosmic radiation activates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. This response triggers the integrated stress response pathway, resulting in the phosphorylation of the cytosolic initiation factor eIF2α. This phosphorylation activates the ATF4 transcription factor, which subsequently upregulates the expression of FGF21 and GDF15, both of which are involved in stress responses [2]. \n\nThe overall findings suggest that cosmic radiation disrupts mitochondrial function, which is a central hub for space biology. This disruption can lead to significant alterations in circadian rhythms, highlighting the need for further research into how these changes might affect astronaut health during long-duration space missions [2]. \n\nIn summary, cosmic radiation affects circadian rhythms by inducing DNA damage, reducing NAD levels, and altering mitochondrial function, which collectively disrupt the regulatory mechanisms of the circadian clock [2].",

There are other sources of physiological and psychological stress during spaceflight, including circadian shifting, dietary alterations, confined spaces, and isolation [2]. The impact of spaceflight and the cosmic environment on those organ systems essential to carry out tasks in space (motor skills, cardiovascular system, and maintenance of overall bodily function) and which are essential upon return to Earth, have received the majority of focus as they relate to studies of astronaut health and wellbeing. A long-standing concern has also been the effects of the cosmic environment on male and female reproductive health including carcinogenesis of the primary reproductive organs secondary to cosmic radiation exposure. However, this area of research lags behind. Advances in molecular biology, genetics, oncology and radiotherapy have provided more insights in recent years [2]; however, there is a paucity of research evaluating the risks of gynecological cancers, ovarian insufficiency, or infertility following spaceflight. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer.",

          "text": "The reduced NADH and radiation-induced DNA damage would reduce NAD levels (Fig. 3G), which would impair the circadian rhythm system through perturbed Sirt1 regulation of BMAL acetylation (Nakahata et al., 2008). Alteration in mitochondrial protein production would activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (Fig. 7A), which would trigger the integrated stress response pathway (Fig. 3C), causing phosphorylation of the cytosolic initiation factor eIF2α. This would activate the ATF4 transcription factor to upregulate expression of FGF21 and GDF15 and induce the mitochondrial supercomplex assembly factor SCAF1 (Balsa et al., 2019a; Khan et al., 2017a). Finally, inhibiting the electron transport chain (Fig. 3G) would alter the mitochondrial metabolites, which serve as the substrates for the epigenome modification enzymes (Kopinski et al., 2019). Overall, this work highlights the power of comparing and integrating multiple omics and data types to understand further how life adapts to spaceflight conditions and risks. We found mitochondrial dysregulation as a central hub for space biology. This concept can guide new nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions and studies that will increase the viability of long-term human-crewed space missions. Health effects from mitochondrial dysfunction should be considered with spaceflight health risk models when planning future human-crewed missions to the Moon and Mars.",
