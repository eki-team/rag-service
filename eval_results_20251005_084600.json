      "answer": "Microgravity has significant effects on bone density in mice, specifically observed in a study involving 16-week-old female C57BL6J mice exposed to microgravity for 15 days during the STS-131 space shuttle mission. The key findings include: 1. **Bone Volume and Thickness**: There was a decrease in bone volume fraction (BVTV) by 6.29% and a reduction in bone thickness by 11.91% in the pelvic region of the mice exposed to microgravity. 2. **Osteoclastic Activity**: The number of TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces increased by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating enhanced osteoclastic bone degeneration. 3. **Lacunar Osteolysis**: High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, with increases in cross-sectional area (17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (6%, p = 0.037). 4. **Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs)**: The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 was up-regulated in microgravity, with fold increases of 12.94, 2.98, and 16.85 respectively (p < 0.01). MMP10 was localized to osteocytes, indicating its role in osteocytic osteolysis. 5. **Cell Cycle Regulation**: The expression of CDKN1ap21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p < 0.01), suggesting a potential inhibition of the cell cycle during tissue regeneration and conferring apoptosis resistance to osteoblasts. Conversely, the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by 1.54 fold (p < 0.01). Overall, these findings indicate that microgravity induces rapid bone loss in the pelvic and femoral regions of the mouse skeleton, primarily through osteoclastic degradation and alterations in cell cycle regulation and osteocytic activity, rather than being limited to osteoclastic activity alone.",

          "text": "Finally, we also hypothesized that reduced mechanostimulation of osteocytes in microgravity may signal the activation of osteocytic osteolysis of lacunar surfaces, with accompanying activation of matrix degradation pathways. Our spaceflight results presented here, suggest that the bone degenerative effects of microgravity in skeletally mature mice go beyond rapid osteoclastic activation, affecting also cell cycle regulation in the osteogenic lineage, and inducing osteocytic osteolysis. All flight and ground control mice were observed to be in good condition by veterinary examination immediately post-landing. Noticeably, the posture of space-flown mouse tails after landing was vertical, indicating increased vestibular function in this group. The average weight loss of space-flown mice was 2.0 g (9.1, SD  2.1 g, p  0.013) significantly lower than pre-flight values, consistent with tissue atrophy in microgravity, while synchronous ground control mice only lost an average of 0.7 g (3.4, SD  0.9 g, p  0.096) of their body weight relative to the beginning of spaceflight. The difference in body weight loss averages for flight versus ground controls was not statistically significant (p  0.143). Flight habitats showed utilization of resources on average of 10 less food, and 24 less water than synchronous ground controls.",

Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL6J mice (n  8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BVTV) of 6.29, and bone thickness of 11.91.

          "text": "The increase in bone volume reached significance in the mice exposed to microgravity while the change in cross-sectional thickness did not, possibly due to bone expansion into the cavities of the skull and the sagittal suture. However, this trend in cross-sectional thickness may be strengthened by a longer stay in microgravity. Tissue mineral density did not vary between the two groups, but past studies of weight-bearing bones [19] indicate that changes in this parameter are generally seen with much longer duration of spaceflight. From previous hindlimb unloading studies, we hypothetically attribute the bone remodeling witnessed by us to the head-ward shift of interstitial fluid (ISF) that accompanies microgravity in the absence of gravity in space. Hillsley and Frangos hypothesize that in microgravity, unloading and decreased vascular and ISF flow to weight-bearing bones promotes degeneration while the same fluid forces redistribute to the head to incite growth [20]. Hindlimb-unloading of rats, another ground-based technique to simulate microgravity, causes decreased perfusion of murine distal extremities and a corresponding rostral increase of fluid pressure [21, 22, 23]. By artificially incrementing intramedullary fluid pressure in the femurs of hindlimb-unloaded rats and noting subsequent increases in bone mineral content and size of the femur, Bergula and co-workers establish the capability of ISF flow to alter bone-remodeling independent of skeletal loading [24].",

Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL6J mice (n  8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BVTV) of 6.29, and bone thickness of 11.",

          "text": "The current literature indicates that simulated microgravity and IR each have detrimental effects on cancellous bone structure, although there is no consensus on whether simulated microgravity and IR cause additive or synergistic effects when combined20,44,45. Thus, more studies are needed to determine whether combining simulated microgravity and IR leads to cumulative effects compared to simulated microgravity and IR alone. Hindlimb unloading (HU) is widely used to simulate the effects of the microgravity environment in rodents46. This model allows for a simulation of the cephalad fluid shift47 and removal of load-bearing forces typically experienced by the hindlimbs, which can lead to increased numbers of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and decreased numbers of bone-forming osteoblasts48. Together, these events result in bone loss as well as reduced bone mechanical properties in rodents4952. In addition, exposure to microgravity in mice adversely affects osteoprogenitors53,54. The bone marrow niche contains osteoblast progenitors cells4 and it has been shown that exposure to microgravity alters the cells proliferation capacity and impairs their ability to produce extracellular matrix, in turn inhibiting the maturation of the bone matrix. Thus, the ability to maintain bone homeostasis is diminished16,5456.",

          "text": "By first gathering evidence on the skeletal changes associated with microgravity, it is possible to explore other physiological changes in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that cause skeletal changes during and post spaceflight in astronauts. Fifteen days of microgravity aboard the STS-131 mission induced adaptive changes in the non-weight-bearing murine calvaria. Of the three parameters measured, there was a statistically significant increase in bone volume, and a trend of increase in cross-sectional thickness. Tissue mineral density remained relatively unchanged. Average weights of the ground control and spaceflight groups before and after fifteen days of cage-loading. Data are mean  SD; n  7 in Spaceflight, 8 in Ground Control groups. Fifteen days of microgravity was enough to instigate substantial weight loss in mice. Average weights of the two groups were essentially the same before cage-loading, with the spaceflight group 0.04 grams heavier at 26.20 grams and the ground control group at 26.16 grams. After their respective fifteen days of being caged, the spaceflight group lost an average of 2.82 grams, tantamount to a 10.76 weight reduction. The ground control group only lost an average of 1.51 grams, equal to 5.77 of its pre-caged weight. This striking difference cannot be sufficiently justified by two days of fasting observed in the spaceflight mice at the start of the mission.",

          "text": "An in-depth, gender-based study of mouse calvaria that includes genomic, proteomic and metabolomic components will further characterize pathways involved in the increase in calvaria growth seen in study populations exposed to microgravity. Future study will also examine the behavior of BMP-2 gene expression levels post-flight, and whether these levels return to baseline prior to euthanasia. These results also suggest that key molecules associated with angiogenesis (VEGFA) and osteogenesis (BMP-2) genes are modulated in BION-M1 mice calvaria exposed to 30 days of microgravity. We suggest that VEGFA and BMP-2 genes are gravity sensors in mouse calvaria. The finding is relevant in the development of countermeasures for prolonged crewed spaceflight and to understand the molecular and structural adaptations of bone and vasculature to the microgravity environment. Lastly, there is a need to monitor the entire astronaut skeletal system on a meta-scale and in a spatio-temporal manner; this type of inquiry will leverage the site-specific, heterogenic skeletal responses and the sufficiency of short-term microgravity exposure to induce upregulation of angiogenic and osteogenic gene expression. The authors recognize several limitations for this study as well as associated opportunities for ongoing study. First, comparisons between study subjects required analysis between genders as well as between varying durations of microgravity and carbon di-oxide exposure.",

      "answer": "Spaceflight significantly impacts immune system function through various environmental factors and physiological changes. Key effects include: 1. **Dysregulated Immune Response**: Astronauts experience alterations in immune cell parameters, including changes in the distribution, function, and proliferation of leukocytes. This dysregulation can lead to increased susceptibility to infections and other immune-related issues during and after space missions . 2. **Cytokine Profiles**: Spaceflight is associated with changes in cytokine profiles, which are crucial for cell signaling in immune responses. These alterations can affect how the immune system communicates and responds to pathogens . 3. **Cell Function Changes**: Specific immune cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells, exhibit altered functions in space. These changes can compromise the body's ability to fight infections effectively . 4. **Increased Pathogen Virulence**: Microbial physiology is also affected by spaceflight, with some pathogens demonstrating increased virulence when grown in space. This poses a significant risk, especially in conjunction with the impaired immune responses observed in astronauts . 5. **Clinical Symptoms**: Immune-related clinical symptoms, such as inflammation, infection, and viral reactivation, are prevalent among astronauts, with an incidence of 3.4 events per flight year reported. This highlights the practical implications of immune dysregulation in space . 6. **Need for Further Research**: While these findings indicate that spaceflight adversely affects the immune system, the underlying pathways and mechanisms remain poorly understood, necessitating further investigation to develop effective countermeasures for future missions . In summary, spaceflight induces significant changes in immune system function, leading to increased risks of infections and other immune-related complications, underscoring the need for ongoing research in this area.",

          "text": "The intense conditions that astronauts encounter in space, including radiation exposure, microgravity, changes in diet, disruption of circadian rhythm and stress, all have an effect on the immune system (Figure 2) [6,215,216,217,218,219,220]. A dysregulated immune response has been well-established during spaceflight, with many changes to immune cell parameters, such as in the distribution, function and proliferation of leukocytes [215,216,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229], cytokine profiles [97,217,219,221,222,229,230,231,232,233] and neutrophil [221,234], monocyte [232,235] and NK cell function [236,237,238]. As discussed earlier, microbial physiology changes as a result of spaceflight, with one such change being increased virulence in some pathogens grown in space [139,144,239,240], which is problematic considering the dysregulated immune responses astronauts experience during spaceflight [6,97]. However, the observation that a vaccine administered in space was able to stimulate an appropriate immune response is promising for long-term missions [97].",

          "text": "Human spaceflight exposes individuals and their immune systems to unique environmental factors, including microgravity, fluid shifts, and radiation1,2. Since 1961, over 675 astronauts have traveled to space; studies on some crew members have shown significant immune stress related to spaceflight3. Given that more individuals with diverse physical and biomedical backgrounds are traveling into spaceand that many more commercial missions are planned (e.g., Polaris Dawn, Axiom)an urgent goal of aerospace medicine is to understand better how the immune system responds to and recovers from spaceflight for the broader civilian population. Moreover, such profiles of cellular and molecular changes in commercial crews can guide personalized countermeasures for the missions and eventually lead to better crew performance and safety4. Immune-related clinical symptoms from spaceflight are prevalent among astronauts and span many phenotypes, including inflammation, infection, and viral reactivation5,6. Indeed, clinical symptoms associated with immune dysregulation were reported with 3.4 events per flight year, representing 46 of crew members6. While these findings show that the spaceflight environment affects the human immune system, they do not reveal the underlying pathways and mechanisms therein, underscoring the need for further studies.

          "text": "While these findings show that the spaceflight environment affects the human immune system, they do not reveal the underlying pathways and mechanisms therein, underscoring the need for further studies. Also, since spaceflight phenocopies many of the effects of aging and aging-related disease (e.g., bone density and muscle loss)7, a better characterization of immune system changes during the extreme physiological stressor of spaceflight can offer insights into immune dysregulation and functional deterioration on Earth. Multi-omic studies provide unique advantages for understanding biological changes, including spaceflight-associated immune system alterations. For example, the NASA Twins Study used gene expression to investigate immune changes stemming from a year-long mission, and found unprecedented levels of cytokines like IL-6 and IL-10, and gene expression changes in both B-cells and T-cells79. However, a major limitation of that study was the sample size, as it involved only one flight subject. It additionally used a bulk-cell analysis for most of the transcriptome (preventing observations at a single-cell resolution) and lacked a chromatin analysis using assays for transposase-accessible chromatin accessibility (ATAC) data8,9, which is critical for understanding changes in genome regulation and long-term stress response. Thus, a high-resolution map of the immune systems response to spaceflight is still needed.",

          "text": "solar particle events, galactic cosmic rays, and the Van Allen belts), and physiologicalpsychological stress (e.g. unloading, work-related stress). Ground-based studies have shown that each of these environmental factors alone can have an impact on immune function. Previously, we and others have shown that the spaceflight environment can have a dramatic influence on immunity. Virtually all immune populations are reduced after spaceflight [2, 4]. Studies in both animal models and humans have shown that the spaceflight environment can influence total body, thymus and spleen mass [718], lymphocyte population distributions [1825] and circulating corticosterone levels [16, 17, 2633]. Interestingly, spaceflight is also known to alter energylipid metabolism [34, 35] and ground-based studies suggest that the stress marker, corticosteronecortisol, plays a significant role [36]. Corticosterone promotes fat breakdown in adipose and muscle tissues to provide glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis [36]. As we demonstrate, metabolomic analysis of the liver indicates that glycerol was more abundant in flight mice relative to ground controls. Furthermore, data from the liver, skin and adrenal gland suggest that spaceflight caused a significant increase in corticosterone levels system-wide. These seemingly unrelated lines of investigation are important because there is a growing body of work describing the interaction between innate immunity and lipid metabolism (S1 Fig).",

          "text": "These examples illustrate ongoing opportunities for synergy between basic and applied researchers and these NASA programs to enhance and accelerate health-risk reduction. The immune system is constantly adapting and is particularly responsive to unique environments such as those in spaceflight, especially for exposures of the long durations required by exploration missions beyond LEO. Immune system dysregulation (decreased responsiveness) has been seen during and after spaceflight and ground-space analog tests by studying humans,54 animals,55 and relevant cell cultures56 and are a priority area for study (AH13-15, Table 1). The specific causes are not yet clear, but are likely linked to one or more of the following factors: physiological stress, circadian rhythm disruption, microgravity exposure, isolation, altered nutrition, or radiation exposure.57 Further, the spaceflight environment compounds crew health risks as some microorganisms become more virulent (see below) and resistant to antibiotic drugs. Even though the reactivation of latent viruses has been well documented in crewmembers,58 it is still unclear if the compromised immune response can lead to increased susceptibility to disease. There is not a sufficiently accurate ground-based analog to study immune suppression from spaceflight.",

          "text": "Finally, while the long-term effects of short-duration spaceflight on the immune system and the genome are minimally understood, particularly in civilians and first-fliers, these data are critical as we expand human presence in orbit and deep space. Additional studies are needed across varying cell types, mission duration, and crew background, which can also help guide countermeasures. Of note, the short-duration space shuttle studies revealed decreased lymphocyte response, post-flight neutrophil increase, and eosinophil decrease, correlating with in-flight stress rather than microgravity [28, 38, 39]. Latent herpesvirus reactivation and cytomegalovirus shedding were also observed during space shuttle flights [18]. Similar adaptations occurred during ISS missions, as crew members experienced mild infectious diseases, atypical allergies, or dermatitis without significant operational impact [18, 32], which seemed to be a function of mission duration. A 12-year ISS immune data comparison indicated improvements in immunity, stress, and viral reactivation due to operational and biomedical countermeasures onboard ISS, such as resupply frequency, improvements in personal communication, exercise equipment, and food quality and variety, suggesting the potential for improved quality of life on the health of astronauts [40].",

          "text": "It will be important to obtain serum in future studies to measure insulin levels in mice and further pursue this link. In conclusion, spaceflight clearly causes transient changes in immune function. However, the cause may not be exclusively due to psychological or oxidative stress. But rather, the shifts in immune function may be at least partially due to shifts in energy needs in space. Onset of leukocyte regeneration after landing could, of course, also have a significant impact on functional status. As a full description of the impact of spaceflight on lipid metabolism is beyond the scope of this paper, the details of this have been covered elsewhere [35]. However, gene expression functional analysis indicated increases in functions related to glucose synthesis and sequestration, with corresponding decreases in glycolysis functions. Furthermore, the ex vivo increases in ROS activity, combined with corresponding increases in peroxisome and endosome-related gene expression, are likely related to spaceflight-induced shifts in lipid metabolism. This further suggests that spaceflight causes a shift in priorities in phagocytic populations away from antigen processing toward lipid processing, potentially increasing risk for infection. Data were obtained using an automated hematology analyzer. Values were normalized to daily Vivarium controls. WBC  white blood cells. LYM  lymphocytes. MON  monocytemacrophages. GRA  granulocytes.

          "text": "Short-term exposure to spaceflight conditions may affect innate immune system components, including functional alterations of key immune cell populations like CD14 monocytes and dendritic cells. Microgravity-induced changes can result in decreased neutrophil and macrophage phagocytic activity, thus affecting the initial response to pathogens. Moreover, microgravity may alter monocyte maturation and function, which play a critical role in antigen presentation and T cell activation. Kaur et al. (2005) describe that, although the percentage of CD14 monocytes was not significantly reduced in astronauts following spaceflight, days after landing, the ability of these cells to engulf pathogens, degranulate, and mount an immune response was reduced compared to that of ground controls [36]. Though little is known about the influence of spaceflight on dendritic cell function, their role in inflammation is well characterized as they play key roles in modulating cytokine production, mediating migration, and enhancing antigen capture and processing [37]. Finally, while the long-term effects of short-duration spaceflight on the immune system and the genome are minimally understood, particularly in civilians and first-fliers, these data are critical as we expand human presence in orbit and deep space. Additional studies are needed across varying cell types, mission duration, and crew background, which can also help guide countermeasures.",

      "answer": "During space missions, significant changes in gene expression occur, particularly related to stress response and physiological adaptations. Key findings include: 1. **Increased m6A Modifications**: There is an observed increase in m6A mRNA modifications immediately post-spaceflight, which are associated with gene markers linked to stress response. This suggests that chemical modifications within RNA molecules play a role in how organisms respond to the unique conditions of spaceflight . 2. **Downregulated Pathways**: After landing, distinct pathways are downregulated, particularly those associated with breathing regulation, such as the uptake and release of CO2 and O2 by erythrocytes. This downregulation is correlated with changes in DNA methylation, indicating a potential interplay between gene expression and methylation in regulating critical respiratory functions . 3. **Physiological Effects**: Spaceflight is associated with various acute physiological effects, including performance impairments and changes in the circulatory and hematological systems. These effects are likely influenced by the unique environmental factors of space, such as microgravity and radiation exposure . 4. **Transcriptomic Studies**: Ground studies have attempted to characterize the impact of individual components of spaceflight, including radiation and microgravity, through transcriptomic profiling. However, direct transcriptomic data from spaceflight is limited, focusing on specific assays like the human IgM repertoire and gene expression profiles from astronaut hair follicle samples . Overall, the changes in gene expression during space missions reflect complex adaptations to the stressors of the space environment, with implications for astronaut health and performance. Future research is needed to further elucidate these mechanisms and their impacts on human physiology in space.",

Both short- and long-term missions into space are correlated with a variety of acute physiological effects, affecting diverse organ and cellular systems13. Astronauts generally experience performance impairment in a wide variety of activities post-spaceflight, requiring reconditioning routines to regain preflight performance4. Significant changes also occur within the circulatory and hematological system during spaceflight, on both a molecular and physiological level, which likely contributes to these effects5. Ground studies collecting transcriptomic profiles of human subjects have attempted to characterize the impact of individual components of spaceflight, such as radiation or microgravity exposure6,7, the latter being simulated with a parabolic flight8. With regard to direct spaceflight exposure, the available transcriptomic data is even more limited, focused on a few specific assays, either sequencing the human IgM repertoire following long-term spaceflight9, measuring the proteome of exhaled breath condensate after long-term spaceflight10, or examining gene expression profiles from astronaut hair follicle samples after long stays on the International Space Station11.",

These results also mirror reported effects of partial gravity and microgravity on lung function, and spaceflight-related hypercapnia linked to increased CO2 levels35,36. Future studies should consider the impact of air quality, convection, and microgravity-related pulmonary challenges for expression and methylation differences. Also, while these samples had to be sequenced on Earth, the development of space-specific, microgravity-compatible sequencing protocols37,38 foreshadows the exciting possibility of real-time monitoring of changes of the transcriptome and epitranscriptome for future missions. Moreover, radiation levels should continue to be monitored during missions, since such stressors can alter telomere dynamics, which have been observed before in the NASA Twins Study39,40 and for mountaineers climbing Mt. Everest25. In addition to capturing differential expression, LRS technologies also capture transcript splicing, potentially allowing for the identification of new regulatory mechanisms and interactions between these two modalities of RNA41.",

          "text": "Furthermore, transcription factors FoxO3, Jun, Myc, and Hif1a were predicted to mediate the interaction between these two pathways, making these genes promising targets for mitigating gene network changes in response to spaceflight. Cat, Cdkn1a, Cdk1 and Cdk4 also were predicted to serve as central hubs of gene networks that are altered by spaceflight. Hence, these molecules may be potential targets for the development of countermeasures against spaceflight-induced tissue deficits. For extrapolation of findings from this murine study to humans, there is the inherent limitation of the difference in species as well as a potential influence of the specific strain and sex which were selected as subjects. Factors related to experimental protocol also important to consider when interpreting gene expression findings from this experiment include the fixed duration of the mission (15 days), sample recovery only after animals were returned to Earth (3 hours after landing), and the fact that ground control animals were housed in flight-matched habitats but were not exposed to similar forces as the flight mice encountered during launch and landing. Therefore, observed changes in gene expression did not solely reflect changes observed during habitation in microgravity, but for rapidly responding genes, such as Nfe2l2, also may reflect re-entry and re-adaptation to 1-gravity on Earth, however briefly.",

          "text": "Moreover, given the civilian background of the I4 astronauts, we note that transcriptomic changes can be confounded with age, biological sex, preflight preparation differences, or divergent postflight recovery procedures, and thus utilized tools that aim to model and normalize such variation. Finally, given the recently proposed missions with private (SpaceX, Axiom, Sierra Space) and public (NASA, ESA, and JAXA) space entities, there will be continued opportunities to replicate these findings and to continue to discover new features of the transcriptome. This will include continued mapping of space-related gene expression responses, m6A site changes, and isoform-switching events that are associated with spaceflight. Also, in-flight testing of direct RNA sequencing has been demonstrated on the ISS, which indicates that LRS of RNA could also be applied for crew studies in future missions, including for blood, microbial, and environmental samples. Optimization and deployment of these single molecule technologies can also aid in the plans for lunar laboratories, in-flight clinical diagnostics, and the ability to discover non-canonical bases or new base modifications for lunar and exploration-class (e.g., Mars) missions.

          "text": "Boxes are the range between first (25) and the third (75) quartile, the center line is the median, the whiskers include the variability those quartiles. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Our data showed robust changes in gene expression profiles after spaceflight. Genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated. Decreased expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Downregulation of microglial gene expression that is important for apoptotic cell clearance, phagocytosis, and proliferation were evident. Genes supporting innate immune responses were also downregulated regarding anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response. Expression of genes that are correlated with DNA damage and cellular stress were upregulated. Many of these observed changes are in line with our previous findings in the brains exposed to simulated spaceflight condition. Following combined exposure of simulated microgravity and radiation, pathways involved in neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, neuronal structure, stress, and cellular signaling are significantly altered29. Gene expression in the brain that was analyzed after 90 days of simulated microgravity showed many genes related to catalytic and oxidoreductase activities were downregulated32.",

          "text": "Martinez et al. found a significant reduction of key gene expression in early T-cell activation in C57BL6J wild-type female mice of similar age and weight flown in space for 15 days [2]. They demonstrated decreases in gene expression for IL2, IL2Rα, and IFNγ during spaceflight. In our data IL2, IL2Rα, and IFNγ gene expression was decreased in the flight group similar to the observations of Martinez et al., but did not reach statistical significance [2]. Pecaut et al. studied age- and weight-matched, 11-week-old female C57BL6J mice flown in space for 13 days [4]. There were increases in liver expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. They suggested that, given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements. Our data demonstrates changes in lipid metabolism in both liver and kidney tissues in space and further clarifies the gene pathway mediators. In the kidney, we confirm many of the pathways implicated in responses to spaceflight and rotating wall suspension culture in renal proximal tubular cells [8,9]. During spaceflight, we confirmed changes we previously observed in kidney gene pathways, including apoptosis and cellular response to peptides [8].",

          "text": "All prior transcriptomics data from spaceflight studies have used short-read sequencing14, and these LRS data showed a unique signature of disrupted gene regulation for astronauts from the Inspiration4 mission, particularly in the hematological system. These data provide the first map of m6A changes from spaceflight, which showed their largest degree of changes on the day of landing (R  1)15,16. The majority of significantly altered pathways was driven by upregulated genes, implying that transcriptional and pathway activity went into figurative overdrive following the short-term, high-elevation space flight. This significant shift in the expression profile may be explained by both direct and indirect effects of spaceflight, such as radiation, changes in gravity, circadian rhythm disruptions, mission stress, and possibly medications, although none were indicated by the crew records. The direct-RNA sequencing data also detailed splicing events for isoforms, while confirming that aberrant splicing in the crew was very low overall. Although many categories of significantly up-regulated pathways were observed, exposure to space radiation in particular may underlie a number of cancer-related pathways, including TSAI response to radiation therapy and Wiemann telomere shortening and chronic liver damage. The set of downregulated pathways after landing was distinct, and notably included genes associated with breathing regulation (e.g., CO2 and O2 takeup and release by erythrocytes).",

As the scope of our investigation focused on RT-PCR, additional studies are needed to elucidate how spaceflight-induced oxidative stress may mediate cell cyclegrowth and function, to gain deeper insight into how the cardiovascular system responds to the space environment and recovers after return to Earth. Furthermore, because the heart consists of multiple cell types, including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages, each with a discrete gene expression profile [53], future experiments could focus on spatial transcriptomics to determine the cellular source of specific gene expression changes, as well as the regulation of protein expression together with cardiac function.

      "answer": "Radiation exposure during spaceflight significantly impacts plant growth, leading to a range of morphological and biological changes collectively referred to as \"space syndrome.\" Key effects include: 1. **Morphological Changes**: Plants exhibit shorter organs and thinner leaves. Roots may grow away from light sources (negative phototropism) and can skew in growth direction. Additionally, root hairs may alter in size, and organelle size and shape can also be modified. 2. **Metabolic Alterations**: There is an accumulation of starch and changes in metabolic pathways, which are indicative of stress responses triggered by the spaceflight environment. 3. **Biological Stress Responses**: The exposure to elevated cosmic radiation induces a variety of biological stress responses in plants. These responses are influenced by environmental cues unique to spaceflight, which can lead to significant changes in plant physiology. 4. **Molecular Pathways**: Research utilizing transcriptomic and proteomic profiling has identified key molecular pathways involved in plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Factors such as calcium signaling, light, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell wall remodeling play crucial roles in these adaptations. 5. **Epigenetic Changes**: Some expression changes in plants have been associated with alterations in DNA methylation patterns, suggesting an epigenetic component to the response to radiation exposure. Overall, the combination of these factors results in complex alterations in plant growth and development during spaceflight, necessitating further research to fully understand the implications of radiation exposure in this unique environment .",

          "text": "Furthermore, exposure to elevated cosmic radiation can substantially impact the morphology, biology, and genetic makeup of plants during spaceflight [9]. Overall, the environmental cues that plants experience during spaceflight trigger a range of biological stress responses that lead to phenotypes collectively named space syndrome. These include shorter organs, thinner leaves, roots tending to grow away from the light source (negative phototropism) while also skewing in some cases, root hairs of altered size, modified organelle size and shape, altered metabolism, and accumulation of starch, to cite only a few [10,11,12,13,14]. Researchers have heavily relied on transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches to reveal key molecular pathways that are responsive to the spaceflight environment relative to ground controls. Experiments using mostly Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings or plant tissue cultures as experimental materials have revealed potential contributions of Ca2, light and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, cell wall remodeling, and defense responses in plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment [6,8,10,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Some of these expression changes were accompanied by alterations in the pattern of CNG and CNN DNA methylation in the proximity of the corresponding genes, suggesting some epigenetic contribution to the process [24].",

          "text": "All of these factors are likely to play into the precise effects this radiation exposure will have on the crew of such a mission, making it complex to extrapolate from terrestrial models to the spaceflight environment. Indeed, the effects of exposure to space radiation have been shown to induce more deleterious effects in tissues than similar doses of ionizing radiation on Earth, with, e.g., as much as 40 times more biological effectiveness to induce Harderian gland cancers in mice6. However, in addition to inducing cancer, radiation exposure in mammals can lead to a wide array of cellular and microenvironment effects such as chronic inflammation, tissue degeneration and impaired nerve function (e.g., refs. 7,8). Indeed, all organisms are subject to radiation effects, with animals, microbes, and plants experiencing a variety of radiation-induced cellular events ranging from DNA damage and oxidative stress to shifts in metabolism9,10. Different species exhibit varying degrees of radiation tolerance and within a species radiation response is modulated by an individuals genetics1114. For example, bacteria in the genus Deinococcus can survive radiation doses far in excess of those that would be lethal in humans15. Predicting such effects are further confounded by the influence of the spaceflight environment, such as living in microgravity, which itself modulates an organisms radiation response (e.g., refs. 1618).",

          "text": "Organisms in space are exposed to radiation, which affects the health of humans and the anatomy and growth of plants and animals [1]. Space missions have to deal with IR in current spacecraft and future long-term deep-space missions [2]. Plants are affected by radiation resulting in damage to cellular components and damage to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) [3]. Exposure to radiation causes DNA lesions in plant cells such as single-stranded breaks, Double Strand Breaks (DSB), mismatches, and modified bases. This leads to DNA Damage Response (DDR) that includes signal transduction, triggering either DNA repair, cell survival, or cell death [4]. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is a member of the mustard family widely used as a model organism in plant biology for studies of the cellular and molecular biology of flowering plants. It has a rapid life cycle of about six weeks from germination to mature plants. It can be easily cultivated in restricted space, has a small genome, a large number of mutant lines, extensive genetic maps, and genomic resources. Hence, it has been chosen as a model organism for spaceflight studies by research communities [5,6]. Similar to observations made on terrestrial plant stressors, spaceflight missions have made extensive observations and collected transcriptional gene regulatory datasets of Arabidopsis [7]. Plants have evolved genes that participate in DNA repair pathways that help the plant to survive the effects of radiation.",

          "text": "Spaceflight, on the other hand, imposes very different constraints on the plants, which they never encountered during their evolution on Earth. During spaceflight, the directional cue provided by gravity is insufficient to modulate gravitropism, gravi-resistance, and other directional cues within the environment. Therefore other tropisms have to take over and guide plant organ growth, including light, gradients in water, oxygen, temperature, ions, and chemicals [2,3]. Similarly, the weightlessness associated with microgravity exposure implies a lack of weight-bearing on plant organs, leading to different mechanical constraints on their growth behaviors [1,4]. Other critical alterations of the physical environment encountered by plants during spaceflight include a lack of gravity-induced convection resulting in diminished gas exchange at the surface of the plant, altered photosynthesis, respiration, hypoxia, and thermoregulation [1,2,5,6,7,8]. Furthermore, exposure to elevated cosmic radiation can substantially impact the morphology, biology, and genetic makeup of plants during spaceflight [9]. Overall, the environmental cues that plants experience during spaceflight trigger a range of biological stress responses that lead to phenotypes collectively named space syndrome.",

          "text": "Understanding how plants respond and adapt to extraterrestrial conditions is essential for space exploration initiatives. Deleterious effects of the space environment on plant development have been reported, such as the unbalance of cell growth and proliferation in the root meristem, or gene expression reprogramming. However, plants are capable of surviving and completing the seed-to-seed life cycle under microgravity. A key research challenge is to identify environmental cues, such as light, which could compensate the negative effects of microgravity. Understanding the crosstalk between light and gravity sensing in space was the major objective of the NASA-ESA Seedling Growth series of spaceflight experiments (20132018). Different g-levels were used, with special attention to micro-g, Mars-g, and Earth-g. In spaceflight seedlings illuminated for 4 days with a white light photoperiod and then photostimulated with red light for 2 days, transcriptomic studies showed, first, that red light partially reverted the gene reprogramming induced by microgravity, and that the combination of microgravity and photoactivation was not recognized by seedlings as stressful. Two mutant lines of the nucleolar protein nucleolin exhibited differential requirements in response to red light photoactivation. This observation opens the way to directed-mutagenesis strategies in crop design to be used in space colonization.",

          "text": "2) is also consistent with an increased exposure of cells to sucrose or glucose, which is known to induce RNA accumulation, rRNA transcription, and ribosome biogenesis in plants (Kojima et al., 2007; Ishida et al., 2016), yeast (Kunkel et al., 2019), and mammals (Hannan et al., 2003). Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the remote possibility that our observations may be influenced by possible interactions between ionizing radiation and phytochrome RFR signaling. For example, low-dose gamma (γ) irradiation of lettuce seeds was found to mimic the effects of FR deactivation of red light-activated phytochromes (Hsiao and Vidaver, 1974). Additionally, a structural study of the bacterial phytochrome from the radiation-resistant bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans established that X-ray radiation induced deprotonation of chromophore in the inactive phytochrome, a biochemical step thought to be involved in light-induced activation of this protein (Li et al., 2015). Although the dose required to deprotonate 50 of the phytochrome (Li et al., 2015) was orders of magnitude larger than that expected to be experienced during our experimental period on the ISS, differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytochromes could affect relevant properties of a hypothetical phytochromeradiation interaction. Interpreting a role for the UPR in the transcriptional response to spaceflight is complicated.",

          "text": "Additionally, the increased radiation exposure inherent in spaceflight is likely to trigger its own array of responses within the plant. The combination of these spaceflight-linked effects is outside the evolutionary history of terrestrial biology and so it remains complicated to predict the effects of spaceflight on organisms. Yet, understanding the molecular and physiological responses of plants to these conditions remains an important goal for space biologists, not the least because plants are integral to many plans for life support on long-duration crewed missions and for colonization9. One way to probe the responses of organisms to spaceflight is by analysis of changes in their transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, genomes and epigenomes induced by exposure to this environment. In the field of plant biology the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASAs) GeneLab data repository10,11 has aggregated many such omics datasets. Critically, the deposited data are associated with extensive metadata covering elements of each experiments design ranging from features of the hardware, radiation exposure and lighting regime to treatment duration, genotype and organism age. Such extensive and accurate metadata are critical to understanding the breadth of differences in experimental designs when making comparisons between studies. This insight is important as the flight hardware used, the analysis methodology employed (e.g.",

          "text": "The possibility that space radiation exposure to increase cardiovascular disease risk requires additional validation similar to the ongoing observations of increased cardiac impairment observed in radiotherapy-treated cancer survivors [11,12]. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks [13], possibly increasing carcinogenic risk [14]. At the molecular level, space radiation from high energy photons and atomic nuclei can cause damage to cellular components, in particular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Damaged DNA, which is inadequately repaired, can led to mutations and chromosomal aberrations that have potential to propagate into RNA, potentially leading to cancer. Simulations using ground-based datasets representative of a combined space radiation and microgravity exposure have demonstrated that oxidative stress processes and mitochondrial dysfunctions are important contributors to biological effects from spaceflight. Simulated microgravity studies have demonstrated an inhibitory effect on cell cycle and cell proliferation [15]. These studies show the value of research centered on understanding the totality of space exposures [16]. A multitude of other biological processes that are affected include increased genomic instability and mutation rates [17], immune dysregulation [18], and deregulated cellular energetics [19].",

      "answer": "Microgravity exposure significantly impacts muscle atrophy, primarily affecting the balance between muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Key findings include: 1. **Muscle Atrophy Mechanisms**: Prolonged exposure to microgravity leads to dysregulation of cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ levels, which is associated with abnormalities in the Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps. This dysfunction hampers muscle relaxation and contributes to muscle atrophy . 2. **Muscle Types Affected**: Both slow-twitch (oxidative) muscles, such as the soleus (SOL), and fast-twitch (glycolytic) muscles, like the tibialis anterior (TA), are susceptible to atrophy under microgravity conditions. Studies have shown that these muscles undergo significant atrophy when exposed to microgravity . 3. **Sex Differences**: Research indicates that biological sex may influence the extent of muscle atrophy. For instance, female mice exhibit more pronounced changes in muscle size regulators, including lower protein synthesis rates and increased activation of protein degradation pathways compared to males during early disuse. Additionally, male rats show greater muscle atrophy than females after two weeks of unloading . 4. **Countermeasures**: While intense physical exercise is the primary countermeasure against muscle atrophy in space, it is not entirely effective, as astronauts require approximately 2.5 hours daily for exercise, and even then, muscle mass cannot be fully maintained . In summary, microgravity leads to significant muscle atrophy through biochemical dysregulation and affects both muscle types differently, with notable variations based on biological sex.",

          "text": "While these new interventions attenuate musculoskeletal loss (Sibonga et al., 2019), they do not fully maintain muscle mass (Tanaka et al., 2017; Trappe et al., 2009). More so, future missions will undoubtedly entail exposure to microgravity exceeding 1 month and may afford more limited exercise countermeasure opportunities. Despite much research into the impact of microgravity on muscle health (Fitts et al., 2001), comparatively little is known about how biological sex impacts interacts with the development of muscle atrophy in this context (Mark, 2007; PloutzSnyder et al., 2014). Recent literature has speculated that physiological differences may affect progression of muscle atrophy (RosaCaldwell  Greene, 2019; Zhong  Zimmers, 2020). For example, female mice are less susceptible to cancer cachexia than male (Hetzler et al., 1852; Lim et al., 2020). Specific to microgravity, recent studies have shown that female mice have more dramatic alterations to moderators of muscle size, including lower protein synthesis rates and greater induction of protein degradative pathways within the early stages of disuse compared to males (RosaCaldwell et al., 2021). In rat studies, 2 weeks of unloading has been shown to result in greater muscle atrophy in males than females (Deschenes  Leathrum, 2016). Moreover, males exhibit a lesser decrement in muscle strength initially but ultimately tend to be more prone to fatigue than females.",

          "text": "These findings could serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel. Subject terms: Molecular biology, Mathematics and computing Muscle atrophy, caused by prolonged exposure to microgravity conditions, is a major challenge faced by astronauts during spaceflight1,2. Although intense physical exercise is currently the main countermeasure, it requires a significant amount of time from each astronaut (2.5 hours per day, including equipment setup and breakdown), and even with exercise, the continuous exposure to microgravity cannot be fully offset. It has been proposed that muscle atrophy may be at least partly explained by the dysregulation of cytoplasmic Ca2 levels due to abnormalities in the Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps ability to reuptake cytoplasmic Ca2 during muscle relaxation1. Mammalian muscles are broadly classified into two types: slow-twitch muscles composed predominantly of oxidative muscle fibers (e.g., postural muscles like the soleus [SOL], which is found in the calf and is important for resisting the pull of gravity) and fast-twitch muscles composed predominantly of glycolytic muscle fibers (e.g., explosive muscles like the tibialis anterior [TA], located in the shin). The SOL and TA are two of the primary muscles impacted by spaceflight, and previous studies have shown that both the murine SOL and TA will atrophy in response to microgravity exposure1,3.",

          "text": "Skeletal muscle atrophy is a secondary effect of aging (sarcopenia) and diseases such as diabetes, cancer and kidney diseases. The primary muscles in the human body are the upper limb and lower limb. Studies have shown that muscle gene expression is different in spaceflight vs. that on the ground. Models of sarcopenia and age-related muscle loss have been studied in [4]. Spaceflight induces similar muscle loss, and the analysis of their gene expression (see [5]) has revealed that a majority of 272 mRNAs that were significantly altered by spaceflight displayed similar responses to hind limb suspension. There are several molecular processes that influence muscle atrophy. The muscle RING-finger protein-1 that plays an important role in muscle remodeling is an E3 ubiquitin ligase expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues [6]. Spaceflight induces unique muscle atrophy in animal models. The MuRF1 nullified mice did not show improvement in soleus muscle loss, showing that atrophy proceeds under unique mechanisms in spaceflight [7]. Muscle mass is a balance between protein generation and degradation. A decreased rate of synthesis causes skeletal muscle wasting. The ubiquitin proteosome is the protein synthesis pathway in muscle atrophy. It has been shown that proteosome inhibition reduces denervation-induced muscle atrophy [8].",

          "text": "However, altered metabolism also plays a significant role6,7. For example, atrophy in flight is not limited to antigravity muscles but also occurs in vascular smooth muscles and cardiac muscles810. To combat muscular atrophy, astronauts exercise (aerobic and resistance) for up to 2.5 h each day. Even with these current countermeasures, the loss in muscle mass is up to 20 during a 5-day to 2-week-long flight, whereas for a long-duration space mission (3 to 6 months), a loss of 30 is noted3,11. In most cases, muscle mass and strength can be regained within a few months to years after returning to Earth by a combination of adapted exercise and rehabilitation11,12. Nevertheless, muscle maintenance in space is still a major concern, and no effective preventive measures exist beyond the limited benefit obtained through exercise. Thus, it is important to determine the mechanisms responsible for the loss of muscle strength in spaceflight and develop appropriate countermeasures. In previous studies, it was shown that alteration in gene expression (e.g., in genes encoding myosin heavy chain kinase and other cytoskeletal proteins) in response to microgravity is similar in cultured embryonic muscle cells1, animals (both vertebrate and invertebrate), and humans10,13.",

          "text": "These results provide more nuances on the possible interactions between sexes during muscle atrophies and emphasize the importance of addressing sexbased differences in research investigations, both on the ground and in space. Long duration spaceflight has been well established to produce substantial muscle loss and reduced functional capability. For example, data in astronauts from the international space station (ISS) have shown 3 loss in muscle mass for every month in microgravity (LeBlanc, Lin, et al., 2000; LeBlanc, Schneider, et al., 2000), with the greatest loss observed in triceps surae and quadriceps muscles (Fitts et al., 2000), that are critical for normal ambulation. Upon return to Earth, this loss of lean mass is associated with reduced health outcomes such as increased risk for injury and chronic lowback pain (PoolGoudzwaard et al., 2015; Stein, 2013; Wing et al., 1991). Recently, interventions, such as prescribed exercise using specialized equipment, have been implemented to mitigate microgravityinduced muscle loss (Petersen et al., 2016; Sibonga et al., 2019; Trappe et al., 2009; Winnard et al., 2017). While these new interventions attenuate musculoskeletal loss (Sibonga et al., 2019), they do not fully maintain muscle mass (Tanaka et al., 2017; Trappe et al., 2009). More so, future missions will undoubtedly entail exposure to microgravity exceeding 1 month and may afford more limited exercise countermeasure opportunities.",

For this reason, researchers have relied on several animal models, most notably the rat hindlimb unloading (HLU) protocol developed in 1979 by Morey et al. which has been established as the standard approach12,13 for ground-based research. However, this model puts considerable stress on the rat tail, which can lead to blood flow restriction, inflammation, and necrosis. More importantly, the HLU model is not suitable to investigate the effects of partial gravity that will be encountered when astronauts reach extra-terrestrial targets such as Mars (38 of Earth gravity, or 0.38g) and the Moon (16 of Earth gravity, or 0.",

          "text": "Apart from microgravity, radiation exposure in spaceflight has been reported to aggravate atrophic processes in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, which is induced already by spaceflight. Radiation was shown to inhibit the reparative processes [9]. Oxidative stress is increased by higher levels of radiation. The upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) counters cellular damage due to radiation which can be artificially induced [10]. Several countermeasures have been proposed for alleviating muscle wastage in spaceflight. Exercise countermeasures do not alleviate the reduction in muscle function or muscle size due to the unloading effects of spaceflight [11]. While exercise countermeasures seem insufficient for maintaining muscle function in long deep space measures, it is important to find effective countermeasures for long duration spaceflights. Bone loss is preserved and tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscle changes are eliminated by countermeasures such as bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL therapies (Denosaumab and OPG-Fc) and treatment of young mice with REGN1033 (a monoclonal antibody against myostatin) [12]. With future space missions, finding effective countermeasures for muscle atrophy in spaceflight has gained paramount importance.",

Subject terms: Human behaviour, Biological techniques Among the many pathophysiological changes that occur during human spaceflight, muscle atrophy is significant and remains a major impediment to deep space exploration1,2. The postural muscles are most affected in the microgravity environment, therefore, impacting the activities of astronauts in long-duration spaceflight missions. Even a weeklong stay at the International Space Station (ISS) can lead to degradation in muscle mass and peak power; this loss could be fatal in off-nominal landing scenarios where assistance might be unavailable. Loss of muscle strength can pose an even more serious problem for interplanetary travel, such as with a venture to Mars, which could take 200 to 300 days. Generally, reduced workload in a microgravity environment is considered to be a primary cause of muscle loss in response to spaceflight35. However, altered metabolism also plays a significant role6,7. For example, atrophy in flight is not limited to antigravity muscles but also occurs in vascular smooth muscles and cardiac muscles810. To combat muscular atrophy, astronauts exercise (aerobic and resistance) for up to 2.5 h each day.",

      "answer": "The environment of the International Space Station (ISS) significantly influences cellular processes in microorganisms, leading to notable adaptations. Key factors include: 1. **Microgravity**: The microgravity conditions of the ISS alter the physiological and metabolic functions of bacteria. Studies have shown that ISS bacterial species exhibit adaptations that enhance their ability to survive in this unique environment, including shifts in cell physiology and metabolism compared to their terrestrial counterparts . 2. **Radiation and Elevated CO2 Levels**: The ISS environment exposes microorganisms to higher levels of radiation and elevated carbon dioxide, which can induce stress responses and promote resilience. This resilience is evidenced by the ability of ISS bacteria to degrade at least two antimicrobial compounds, indicating advanced metabolic capabilities under stress . 3. **Biofilm Formation**: The ISS conditions favor the formation of biofilms, which are complex assemblages of microorganisms. Research highlights the importance of minimizing local moisture to prevent potentially harmful biofilms, as these can impact both the ISS environment and human health . 4. **Genomic Adaptations**: Genomic analyses of ISS bacterial species reveal the presence of novel genes, including P-type translocating transportases and metallopeptidases, which suggest advanced mechanisms for survival and resistance in the harsh conditions of space . The lack of homologous genes in terrestrial relatives indicates significant evolutionary adaptations to the ISS environment . In summary, the ISS environment affects cellular processes by inducing physiological changes, promoting resilience against stressors, and facilitating unique genomic adaptations that enhance survival in microgravity and other extreme conditions.",

          "text": "Additionally, as Mora et al. highlighted in their work [36], the genomic and physiological features selected by ISS conditions, though not directly pertinent to human health, exhibit considerable adaptations for biofilm formation and surface interactions. Their research underscores the importance of minimizing local moisture to prevent the formation of potentially harmful biofilms. Metabolic assays indicate that all ISS bacterial species have the ability to degrade at least two antimicrobial compounds (Supplementary Fig. S3ab), showcasing their resilience in a controlled, high-stress environment. These bacteria also harbor various P-type translocating transportases and metallopeptidases within their pool of novel genes (Supplementary Table S12), suggesting advanced mechanisms for survival and resistance. Similarly, Earth analogs have evolved to degrade antimicrobial compounds, especially in environments heavily influenced by human activity, such as hospitals and agricultural sites [31]. The thorough examination of genomes of five novel ISS bacterial species, when compared with their closest terrestrial counterparts, unveiled clear adaptations to the rigors of ISS space environment. Notably, significant shifts in cell physiology and metabolism were seen. The extent to which genes lacked homologs in their terrestrial relatives was found to be associated with their phylogenetic distance.",

          "text": "They form complex dynamic assemblages in every ecosystem, and their interactions shape the biotic and abiotic environments [13]. Beyond natural environments such as the soil or the ocean, microorganisms abound in all human habitats, where they directly impact human health [4]. The human-made International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and controlled system to study the interplay between the human microbiome and the microbiome of their habitats. The ISS is a hermetically sealed closed system, yet it harbors many microorganisms that survive extreme environmental conditions such as microgravity, radiation and elevated CO2 levels [58]. Recent studies have demonstrated the unique link between crew member microbiomes and surface microbiomes on the ISS [9]. These microorganisms might have been brought into the ISS via routine payloads and astronauts [9]. Several studies have focused on microbial isolation [10] and molecular microbial community analyses of the ISS microbiome, through experiments performed on vacuum filter debris [11], high-efficiency particle arrestance (HEPA) filters [12, 13], the ISS environmental surfaces [8, 14] and astronauts microbiome [9]. A recent report using a shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach on intact cells of the ISS environmental microbiome revealed the succession and persistence of certain microbial populations on the ISS environmental surfaces [15].",

In contrast, Earth analogous strains show a greater diversity in these genes, driven by varied environmental challenges and human influences like antibiotic use and pollution ([34]. Genomes of all ISS bacterial species contain genes involved in biofilm formation, potentially posing a pathogenic risk to humans under specific conditions, even though these genera and their closest terrestrial relatives are not typically known to be infectious agents. Comparatively, Earth counterparts also form biofilms, but the selective pressures driving this ability differ. On Earth, biofilm formation is often a response to environmental challenges such as antibiotic exposure and surface colonization in diverse habitats. In contrast, ISS bacteria have shown adaptations favoring biofilm formation and surface interactions due to the unique conditions of the space environment, such as microgravity and limited nutrient availability [35].

          "text": "The ISS is another type of environment that may be considered hostile for microorganisms, featuring constant temperature and humidity, controlled airflow, enhanced irradiation, and microgravity (Mora et al., 2016). Several reports examining microbial burden aboard the ISS have shown that fungal populations thrive in this environment (Checinska et al., 2015; Be et al., 2017). Other studies have investigated molecular adaptations of selected species to space conditions, revealing changes in metabolome, and proteome of ISS-isolated strains (Knox et al., 2016; Romsdahl et al., 2018; Blachowicz et al., 2019). In other investigations, several multilayered or embedded cryptoendolithic fungal communities were exposed to space conditions (Billi et al., 2011; Onofri et al., 2012, 2015; Scalzi et al., 2012; Pacelli et al., 2018). Tested isolates that adapted to environmental extremes of their habitats survived SMC for extended periods and revealed high stability of the DNA in the surviving cells (Billi et al., 2011; Onofri et al., 2015; Pacelli et al., 2018). Despite these studies, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that facilitate survival of filamentous fungi under SMC and their potential to adapt and survive in outer space. This is the first report that evaluated the survival of Chernobyl-associated and ISS-isolated fungal conidia exposed in monolayers to SMC.",

          "text": "Due to the technically rigorous methods required for culturing many microorganisms, characterization of human-associated microbial populations in the ISS environment remains a significant challenge. However, it is important to monitor the presence of any opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms. As long-duration human missions are planned in the future, detection of human pathogens and possible mitigation practices must be developed. In addition, understanding of the ISS microbiome could facilitate the necessary maintenance of this closed habitat and thereby assist in preventing degradation of its components by some microorganisms [4]. Both ISS environment and cleanrooms on Earth are maintained by high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters. Importantly, considerable prior knowledge of the microbial communities associated with these cleanrooms exists from prior studies. The ISS has been exposed to these communities indirectly by the fact that some of the cargos sent to the ISS were packaged in these specific NASA cleanrooms. As in the case of the ISS closed habitat, the Earth-based cleanrooms are controlled for humidity, temperature, and circulation. Furthermore, NASA quality assurance engineers perform periodic audits to ensure that certified-facility cleanliness levels conform to the requirements delineated for both the ISS and Earth cleanrooms. The ISS environment is zero gravity with exposure to space radiation and elevated carbon dioxide levels.",

          "text": "The environment of the International Space Station (ISS) presents novel challenges for all terrestrial organisms, which evolved in the unit gravity of Earth. Microgravity is the most obvious challenge of spaceflight; however, other aspects of the spaceflight environment, such as radiation from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles, and vibration contribute to the complexity of this novel environment. When terrestrial organisms are transported to the ISS, they respond by adjusting metabolic processes to physiologically adapt to this new spaceflight environment. One readout of the physiological changes induced by spaceflight is in the patterns of gene expression. Plants are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment, and are particularity attuned to changes in gravity. Individual genes have been implicated as important to the altered gravity physiological adaptation through assays with deletion mutants [1,2] and with specific assays of expression [3,4,5,6,7]. Genome-wide evaluations have also provided a large-scale view of the changes elicited by disrupted terrestrial gravity environments [8,9,10,11]. Plants exhibit widespread changes in their patterns of gene expression in the absence of gravity, such as in response to the spaceflight environment [4,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24].",

          "text": "Astronaut-ISS surface exchange would parallel what has been found with Earth-based built environment studies, where human occupation significantly impacts a given indoor environment [2, 31, 32]. To garner a better understanding of just how significant human-environment interactions are in shaping the microbiomes of the ISS and the astronauts residing there, ongoing analyses by the MT-2 project team are examining astronaut data at pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight time points and examining their microbiomes in conjunction with the ISS surface microbiome. Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. While bacteria dominated the ISS microbiome in both the PMA and non-PMA samples, it is worth noting that the proportion of fungi increased from 10 in the total population (viabledead) to 37 in the viable population, while bacteria decreased from 82 (total) to 58 (viable). This would suggest that viableintact fungal cells are more readily captured when ISS surfaces are sampled, compared to bacteria. This could be because these fungi are able to withstand the routine cleaning regimes on the ISS or the conditions surrounding the sample storagedescent to Earthsample processing, better than those bacteria. In addition to examining which microbes were present, we also examined their properties, which may help inform policies and practices to mitigate harmful effects on astronauts and the spacecraft.",

          "text": "Astronaut-ISS surface exchange would parallel what has been found with Earth-based built environment studies, where human occupation significantly impacts a given indoor environment [2, 31, 32]. To garner a better understanding of just how significant human-environment interactions are in shaping the microbiomes of the ISS and the astronauts residing there, ongoing analyses by the MT-2 project team are examining astronaut data at pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight time points and examining their microbiomes in conjunction with the ISS surface microbiome. Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. While bacteria dominated the ISS microbiome in both the PMA and non-PMA samples, it is worth noting that the proportion of fungi increased from 10 in the total population (viabledead) to 37 in the viable population, while bacteria decreased from 82 (total) to 58 (viable). This would suggest that viableintact fungal cells are more readily captured when ISS surfaces are sampled, compared to bacteria. This could be because these fungi are able to withstand the routine cleaning regimes on the ISS or the conditions surrounding the sample storagedescent to Earthsample processing, better than those bacteria. In addition to examining which microbes were present, we also examined their properties, which may help inform policies and practices to mitigate harmful effects on astronauts and the spacecraft.",

Key changes include: 1. **Cardiovascular Deconditioning**: Astronauts experience cardiovascular deconditioning, which is characterized by a reduction in left ventricular mass and impairments in heart function . 2. **Orthostatic Intolerance**: A significant number of astronauts (approximately 50-80%) develop orthostatic intolerance upon return to Earth, which is linked to difficulties in raising peripheral resistance . 3. **Fluid Redistribution**: There is a cephalad fluid shift due to altered microgravity levels, leading to transient atrial distension and hypovolemia . 4. **Vascular Changes**: Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading have been shown to impair vasoconstriction in resistance arteries, particularly in the gastrocnemius muscle . Additionally, defects in endothelium-dependent vasodilation have been noted in resistance arteries of both mouse gastrocnemius and rat soleus muscles . 5. **Increased Risk of Thrombosis**: Stagnant or retrograde venous flow and thrombosis have been reported in crew members during flight, contributing to cardiovascular complications . 6. **Heart Rhythm Disturbances**: Postflight, astronauts may experience disturbances in heart rhythm, further complicating cardiovascular health . These findings underscore the need for targeted countermeasures, particularly focusing on antioxidant and immune pathways, as well as considering sex differences in the development of these strategies to maintain cardiovascular health in space .",

          "text": "RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space. Keywords: hindlimb unloading, microgravity, cardiovascular system, immune response, transcriptomics Spaceflight leads to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of mitigation strategies. Cardiovascular changes in response to spaceflight are attributed to altered microgravity levels and the ensuing cephalad fluid shift [1]. Overall reductions in physical activity and other factors such as nutritional changes, elevated CO2 levels, and a demanding workload also may be contributing factors. Some of the reported cardiovascular changes caused by exposure to the spaceflight environment include reductions in left ventricular mass [2,3], transient atrial distension [4], and hypovolemia [5]. Stagnant or retrograde venous flow as well as thrombosis have been observed in crew during flight [6]. Heart rhythm disturbances postflight also have been reported [7]. Orthostatic intolerance [8] and stiffer carotid arteries [9] have also been observed in crew upon return to Earth.",

          "text": "Increased VEGF levels from over-expression of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFα) promotes both angiogenesis and osteogenesis, while loss of HIF1a in osteoblasts resulted in thinner and less vascularized bones [88]. Cardiovascular deconditioning is one of the potential health risks associated with spaceflight [89,90]. A majority of astronauts experience orthostatic intolerance upon return from long-duration flight (129190 days) [89,91,92,93] which is attributed to impairments in raising peripheral resistance [79]. Muscle vasculature plays an integral role in elevating peripheral resistance and, therefore, has been the subject of a number of studies using spaceflight models. In rodents, both spaceflight and hindlimb unloading impair vasoconstriction of gastrocnemius resistance arteries [94,95]. In addition, resistance arteries of mouse gastrocnemius [96] and rat soleus [97] both display defects in endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In rats, the soleus resistance arteries exhibit diminished expression levels of eNOS and SOD1, although the gastrocnemius resistance arteries do not show such alterations [97,98]. The basis for the site-specific differences in redox status of vascular resistance arteries is not fully understood. However, there is speculation that this is partly due to region-specific differences in perfusion andor differences in metabolic rates of slow versus fast twitch muscle fibers and the relative abundance of these fiber types in the two muscle sites.",

          "text": "Entering into microgravity causes a cephalad shift of body fluids which leads to increased heart stroke volume, a rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and a fluid shift between the vasculature and interstitium [4,5,6]. The fluid shift invokes compensatory endocrine and renal mechanisms [6]. These alterations can diminish the capability of the heart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to orthostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts [7]. Gravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning [8], despite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space Station (ISS). Both spaceflight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for human spaceflight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy [9,10]. A reduction in myocardial interstitial fluid may contribute to lower myocardial mass following microgravity exposure [11]. In rodents, 14 days of spaceflight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy [12]. In contrast, spaceflight for one week did not affect cardiac mass [13], although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy.",

          "text": "Microgravity at low earth orbit (LEO), experienced aboard the International Space Station (ISS), causes changes in gravity-dependent fluid flow within the cardiovascular system [1,2,3]. Changes in cardiac output, heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, and heart morphology have been reported following exposure to the spaceflight environment [4,5,6]. The low-dose radiation environment in space can also initiate structural damage at the DNA, cellular, and organ levels [2]. Ongoing studies using multi-omics suggest that the impact of spaceflight appears to vary depending on the model, the organ system, the differentiation status of the cells, and the length of spaceflight exposure [7,8]. Studies focused on the cardiovascular system have shown that human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) cultured on the International Space Station (ISS) responded to the spaceflight environment by altering the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function [9]. In the cardiac tissue of mice, transcriptional changes induced after 15 days in space include the differential expression of genes related to the cell cycle, senescence, and redox balance [10]. Cardiac remodeling and alterations in the expression of proteasome and extracellular matrix genes occurred in the hearts of Drosophila after 30 days in spaceflight [11]. Little is known, however, about transcriptomic changes in mammalian hearts in vivo following 30 days of spaceflight.",

          "text": "In addition, a subset of the DEGs resulting from spaceflight were associated with cardiovascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular decompensation, hypertensive disease and myocardial infarction. Cardiovascular decompensation and volumetric changes in blood flow were consistent with previous observations in crew members during flight [3,8,74]. In a previous study on a subset of ISS crewmembers, mean arterial pressures reportedly do not change significantly during spaceflight. However, cardiac output and stroke volume are increased in flight compared to the seated position on Earth (although comparable to the supine position on Earth) [3]. Thus, our findings were consistent with previous reports on astronauts indicating that spaceflight adversely affects cardiovascular health. Computational analyses also indicated that spaceflight led to altered regulation of molecular networks within the oxidative damage response and cell proliferation pathways. Our findings suggest that oxidative stress and Trp35 signaling pathways were linked and that spaceflight alters gene interactions between these two pathways. Furthermore, transcription factors FoxO3, Jun, Myc, and Hif1a were predicted to mediate the interaction between these two pathways, making these genes promising targets for mitigating gene network changes in response to spaceflight. Cat, Cdkn1a, Cdk1 and Cdk4 also were predicted to serve as central hubs of gene networks that are altered by spaceflight.",

          "text": "The basis for the site-specific differences in redox status of vascular resistance arteries is not fully understood. However, there is speculation that this is partly due to region-specific differences in perfusion andor differences in metabolic rates of slow versus fast twitch muscle fibers and the relative abundance of these fiber types in the two muscle sites. Similar to the observations in muscle resistance arteries, the vasculature of bone also exhibits functional impairments under spaceflight conditions. Two weeks of HU in rats results in deficits in vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA) [99], the primary route for blood circulation to the femur. HU animals display decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and increases in vascular resistance. These changes are not attributed to enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries, but are associated with decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilation and vascular remodeling that reduces PNA maximal diameter. The skeleton, like muscle, undergoes deconditioning during spaceflight (and its analogs) which manifests as a reduction in bone mass due to a transient net increase in resorption [100,101,102] as well as diminished mechanical strength [4]. These coincide with functional impairments and changes in redox status in associated vasculature [93].",

          "text": "Stagnant or retrograde venous flow as well as thrombosis have been observed in crew during flight [6]. Heart rhythm disturbances postflight also have been reported [7]. Orthostatic intolerance [8] and stiffer carotid arteries [9] have also been observed in crew upon return to Earth. Crew on exploration-class missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will experience prolonged periods of microgravity and exposure to low doses of space radiation given current spacecraft shielding designs. Therefore, it is important to understand the cardiovascular responses to long-duration spaceflight to mitigate potential health risks. The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model [10,11] has been used to gain insights into some aspects of human cardiovascular responses to microgravity and cephalad fluid shifts. HU for four weeks in rats resulted in decreased left ventricular mass and volume [12], consistent with findings from a number of bed rest studies [2,13,14,15,16] and from spaceflight [3]. Two weeks of HU in rats perturbs daynight blood pressure (BP) and heart rate regulation [17]. Compared to baseline (pre-HU) values, HU generally led to increased systolic and diastolic BP during both day and night cycles, whereas heart rate was increased during the day but not at night.

          "text": "In rodents, 14 days of spaceflight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy [12]. In contrast, spaceflight for one week did not affect cardiac mass [13], although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported to cause cardiac atrophy in some studies [14,15], but not in others [13], thus further work in this area is needed. In addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose astronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and vascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction [16,17,18]. In fact, spaceflight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related to metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and animals [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in space, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative stress-related pathways are not yet understood. Activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signal transduction pathways are major stress responses important for defending against many physiological and environmental challenges, including tissue oxidative stress.",

      "answer": "Cosmic radiation impacts DNA damage primarily through the induction of complex lesions, particularly double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are critical for cellular response and adaptation to radiation exposure. The nature of cosmic radiation, which includes high-linear energy transfer (LET) particles, leads to direct DNA damage, contrasting with lower LET radiation (like gamma or X-rays) that induces damage indirectly through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from water radiolysis. High-LET particles cause extensive DSBs that are not limited to peripheral heterochromatin but affect the entire nucleus, increasing the likelihood of genetic rearrangements and loss of genetic information due to the repair processes employed by eukaryotic cells, such as non-homologous end joining and allelic recombination. These repair mechanisms can lead to cytogenetic lesions, cell death, or oncogenic transformations through the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or activation of oncogenes . Additionally, cosmic radiation can induce epigenetic modifications, which may occur globally throughout the nucleus and correlate with chromatin states. Specifically, changes in DNA methylation have been observed, particularly in low-expression (heterochromatic) regions of chromosomes, suggesting that the structural organization of chromatin plays a role in the cellular response to radiation . In summary, cosmic radiation leads to significant DNA damage characterized by DSBs and associated epigenetic changes, with implications for cellular health and genetic integrity.",

          "text": "Ionizing radiations ability to induce genetic mutations had been established [24] well before the elucidation of the DNA double helix structure by Watson and Crick, or even before the Hershey-Chase experiment, which demonstrated that DNA is indeed the genetic material. The effects of ionizing radiation on DNA tend to be more serious than other biological macromolecules, with delayed systemic health effects being the outcome of DNA and chromosomal damage [25, 26]. The majority of cellular DNA lesions caused by ionizing radiation differ significantly from those caused by endogenous sources in their physical and chemical properties [27]. The most important features of radiation-induced DNA lesions are their complexity and clustering [28]. The radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) tend to be the most crucial for the cell fate and can thus be considered to be a basic trigger for the cellular response and adaptation to the radiation exposure [29, 30]. Because eukaryotic cells primarily repair DSBs via the method of non-homologous end joining or allelic recombination (see below), there exists an unfortunate tendency to lose genetic information by means of loss of heterozygosity and deletions, as well as genetic rearrangements [31]. This can lead to serious cytogenetic lesions and cell death, or transformation and oncogenicity via the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or the activation of certain oncogenes [3234].",

          "text": "Photonic (gamma or X-ray) radiation primarily induces DNA damage indirectly through free radicals (ROS) generated by water radiolysis. Conversely, ions with high-LET directly damage DNA. Dense heterochromatin acts as a protective shield against ROS, yet it provides more DNA targets per volume for accelerated particles. Crucially, the extensive induction of DSBs by high-LET ions is not confined to peripheral heterochromatin but extends to the entire nucleus5052. Hence, specific methylation changes may be generated as part of the systemic response of cells to irradiation. Indeed, post-irradiation epigenetic modifications have been shown not only to occur at sites of DSB damage, but also globally, throughout the cell nucleus53. Such a response can occur because chromatin represents a regulatory network and responses to various stresses as a system54,55. Hence, it seems more probable that these observations may be associated with chromatin accessibility and multidimensional architecture of these sequences rather than the epigenetic modification itself that makes H3K4me3 and H3K27ac-marked sequences more susceptible to radiation. Interestingly, Caron et al., found that most DMPs were located in chromosomes with low gene expression and located more peripherally compared to chromosomes with high gene expression. Thus, the intensity of DNA methylation changes correlates with both the low-expression (heterochromatic) state of chromatin and the peripheral location of chromatin.",

          "text": "This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation. Building on previous work by Kennedy et al. (Sci Rep 8(1): 6709. 10.1038S41598-018-24755-8), we evaluated spatial DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET (56Fe, 28Si) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation and the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic architecture in distinct radial layers of cell nucleus. Next, we validated our results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily 56Fe induces a persistent DNA methylation increase whereas 28Si and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic and transcriptomic response as well as chromatin multidimensional structure influence on galactic cosmic radiation damage. Subject terms: Computational biology and bioinformatics, Molecular biology, Space physics With a growing interest in space travel1, it is pivotal to better understand how galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) impacts human health and how its detrimental effect can be minimized2.",

Continued progress in elucidating which DNA repair proteins result in increased DNA repair capabilities and which do not will aid in the eventual determination of which DNA repair proteins can be usefully overexpressed for the purposes of enhancing radioresistance in humans. However, as with the case of overexpression of endogenous antioxidants, even those DNA repair proteins that show largely beneficial effects in terms of mutagenesis protection may reduce the clinical efficacy of radiation therapy for cancer in the event of subsequent carcinogenesis due to enhanced DNA repair capabilities in cancer cells when constitutively expressed [245], while simultaneously enhancing protection from carcinogenesis prior to actual malignant transformation. It would therefore also be prudent to use inducible expression constructs (e.g. inducible promoters) in the case of overexpression of DNA repair genes as well, and to explore the possibility of using tissue and organ-specific inducible promoters to open up the possibility of halting the administration of the inducible promoters trigger stimulus exclusively in the tumors tissue of origin, while still maintaining the radioprotective benefits of DNA repair gene overexpression in all other tissues and organs. DNA repair processes have evolved to repair isolated endogenous DNA damage.",

          "text": "Delta-rays). In contrast, low-LET deposit their energy uniformly and are often referred as sparsely ionizing radiation. The most problematic type of DNA lesions induced by ionizing radiation are DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Both low- and high-LET induce DSBs, but the complexity of damage varies with LET. We previously reviewed this topic in detail [36]. Briefly, if we accept the convention that a simple DSB is made of one break on each strand within a 10 base-pair region and complex DSB have at least one additional break between these two strand breaks, then roughly 80 of high-LET induced DSB are complex against only 20 for low-LET [37, 38]. The higher carcinogenic effect for high-LET [9, 39] has been explained primarily via the larger amount of complex break which hypothetically lead to more unrepairable lesions. All eukaryotic organisms have evolved against a backdrop of constant exposure to endogenous and exogenous mutagens, and as such have developed robust cellular mechanisms for DNA repair and protection against DNA damage. The mechanisms of cellular protection against DNA damage and mutation and of DNA repair can be categorized as immediate and adaptive defense mechanisms. Immediate defense mechanisms include: The production of antioxidants and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers that neutralize ROS produced by oxygen metabolism, ionizing radiation and UV radiation [4043].",

          "text": "The mechanisms of cellular protection against DNA damage and mutation and of DNA repair can be categorized as immediate and adaptive defense mechanisms. Immediate defense mechanisms include: The production of antioxidants and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers that neutralize ROS produced by oxygen metabolism, ionizing radiation and UV radiation [4043]. DNA repair [4447], including direct reversal repair, base excision repair (BER) [4851], nucleotide excision repair (NER) [5254] and mismatch repair [4447] for single strand modifications, and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), homologous recombination for double strand breaks (DSBs), and interstrand crosslink repair for modifications affecting both strands [5558]; Elimination of damaged cells via apoptosis [5964], and Proliferative arrest and replicative senescence [5558, 65, 66] Substantial experimental evidence suggests that low-dose radiation may trigger a variety of protective responses within cells, tissues and organisms that serve to protect them from both exogenous (e.g high doses of radiation) [67] and endogenous (e.g. age-related accumulation of DNA damage) [68] genomic instabilities [6971]. Importantly, these responses, collectively termed radioadaptive responses or radiation hormesis, may protect against spontaneous or induced cancer [72].",

          "text": "Ionizing radiation can impact the cells directly, where the particles impact a vital target molecule and directly transfer their energy, or indirectly, where particles impact other molecules, such as water, leading to longer lasting, very reactive free radicals. When impacting DNA, ionizing radiation can cause single-strand or double-strand DNA breaks. Double-strand DNA breaks, especially those caused by close single hits or high-energy hits, are much harder to repair. Non-rejoined breaks can lead to cell death, while incorrectly rejoined breaks can lead to mutation. Space radiation has a complex impact on human tissues and is an etiological agent for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system impairment, radiation sickness, and other harmful conditions [3,13]. The Earths magnetic field is a crucial protective element. Given the nature of ionizing space radiation, an increased rate of carcinogenesis is a primary concern for long-duration spaceflight [14]. While no increase in gynecologic cancer risk has yet been revealed in the female astronaut population [15,16], as exploration missions will be outside of low Earth orbit and for increasingly long durations, concern remains regarding the effects of even a low-dose rate accumulating over time [17]. The three main sources of ionizing space radiation are galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and the Van Allen radiation belt [18].",

          "text": "The intense conditions that astronauts encounter in space, including radiation exposure, microgravity, changes in diet, disruption of circadian rhythm and stress, all have an effect on the immune system (Figure 2) [6,215,216,217,218,219,220]. A dysregulated immune response has been well-established during spaceflight, with many changes to immune cell parameters, such as in the distribution, function and proliferation of leukocytes [215,216,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229], cytokine profiles [97,217,219,221,222,229,230,231,232,233] and neutrophil [221,234], monocyte [232,235] and NK cell function [236,237,238]. As discussed earlier, microbial physiology changes as a result of spaceflight, with one such change being increased virulence in some pathogens grown in space [139,144,239,240], which is problematic considering the dysregulated immune responses astronauts experience during spaceflight [6,97]. However, the observation that a vaccine administered in space was able to stimulate an appropriate immune response is promising for long-term missions [97].",

          "text": "Human spaceflight exposes individuals and their immune systems to unique environmental factors, including microgravity, fluid shifts, and radiation1,2. Since 1961, over 675 astronauts have traveled to space; studies on some crew members have shown significant immune stress related to spaceflight3. Given that more individuals with diverse physical and biomedical backgrounds are traveling into spaceand that many more commercial missions are planned (e.g., Polaris Dawn, Axiom)an urgent goal of aerospace medicine is to understand better how the immune system responds to and recovers from spaceflight for the broader civilian population. Moreover, such profiles of cellular and molecular changes in commercial crews can guide personalized countermeasures for the missions and eventually lead to better crew performance and safety4. Immune-related clinical symptoms from spaceflight are prevalent among astronauts and span many phenotypes, including inflammation, infection, and viral reactivation5,6. Indeed, clinical symptoms associated with immune dysregulation were reported with 3.4 events per flight year, representing 46 of crew members6. While these findings show that the spaceflight environment affects the human immune system, they do not reveal the underlying pathways and mechanisms therein, underscoring the need for further studies. Also, since spaceflight phenocopies many of the effects of aging and aging-related disease (e.g.",

Also, since spaceflight phenocopies many of the effects of aging and aging-related disease (e.g., bone density and muscle loss)7, a better characterization of immune system changes during the extreme physiological stressor of spaceflight can offer insights into immune dysregulation and functional deterioration on Earth. Multi-omic studies provide unique advantages for understanding biological changes, including spaceflight-associated immune system alterations. For example, the NASA Twins Study used gene expression to investigate immune changes stemming from a year-long mission, and found unprecedented levels of cytokines like IL-6 and IL-10, and gene expression changes in both B-cells and T-cells79. However, a major limitation of that study was the sample size, as it involved only one flight subject. It additionally used a bulk-cell analysis for most of the transcriptome (preventing observations at a single-cell resolution) and lacked a chromatin analysis using assays for transposase-accessible chromatin accessibility (ATAC) data8,9, which is critical for understanding changes in genome regulation and long-term stress response. Thus, a high-resolution map of the immune systems response to spaceflight is still needed.",

          "text": "These examples illustrate ongoing opportunities for synergy between basic and applied researchers and these NASA programs to enhance and accelerate health-risk reduction. The immune system is constantly adapting and is particularly responsive to unique environments such as those in spaceflight, especially for exposures of the long durations required by exploration missions beyond LEO. Immune system dysregulation (decreased responsiveness) has been seen during and after spaceflight and ground-space analog tests by studying humans,54 animals,55 and relevant cell cultures56 and are a priority area for study (AH13-15, Table 1). The specific causes are not yet clear, but are likely linked to one or more of the following factors: physiological stress, circadian rhythm disruption, microgravity exposure, isolation, altered nutrition, or radiation exposure.57 Further, the spaceflight environment compounds crew health risks as some microorganisms become more virulent (see below) and resistant to antibiotic drugs. Even though the reactivation of latent viruses has been well documented in crewmembers,58 it is still unclear if the compromised immune response can lead to increased susceptibility to disease. There is not a sufficiently accurate ground-based analog to study immune suppression from spaceflight.",

Additional studies are required to assess the true risks of humans developing deleterious inflammatory responses andor autoimmune manifestations during long-term space travel. With increased laboratory facilities and safety barriers on the International Space Station, performing such experiments using in vivo infectious and autoimmune disease models will be possible. Determining the nature of immune dysregulation during spaceflight and potential countermeasures will be critical for protecting of the health of humans who venture on long-term space voyages. Finally, understanding spaceflight immune dysregulation may reveal fundamental and previously unappreciated aspects of how the immune system functions under Earths gravity and provide critical insights into the mechanisms of immune dysfunction in various human diseases.

          "text": "solar particle events, galactic cosmic rays, and the Van Allen belts), and physiologicalpsychological stress (e.g. unloading, work-related stress). Ground-based studies have shown that each of these environmental factors alone can have an impact on immune function. Previously, we and others have shown that the spaceflight environment can have a dramatic influence on immunity. Virtually all immune populations are reduced after spaceflight [2, 4]. Studies in both animal models and humans have shown that the spaceflight environment can influence total body, thymus and spleen mass [718], lymphocyte population distributions [1825] and circulating corticosterone levels [16, 17, 2633]. Interestingly, spaceflight is also known to alter energylipid metabolism [34, 35] and ground-based studies suggest that the stress marker, corticosteronecortisol, plays a significant role [36]. Corticosterone promotes fat breakdown in adipose and muscle tissues to provide glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis [36]. As we demonstrate, metabolomic analysis of the liver indicates that glycerol was more abundant in flight mice relative to ground controls. Furthermore, data from the liver, skin and adrenal gland suggest that spaceflight caused a significant increase in corticosterone levels system-wide. These seemingly unrelated lines of investigation are important because there is a growing body of work describing the interaction between innate immunity and lipid metabolism (S1 Fig).",

          "text": "Multiple studies have described immune dysregulation in short or long-term simulated14 or actual microgravity59. For the most part, such studies have described impaired T-cell responses, coupled with some form of heightened innate immunity7,10, though some innate immune cells, like natural killer (NK) cells, also show impaired function11. Consistent with altered adaptive immunity, potentially due to impaired cytotoxic and Th1 T cell function, and reduced NK cell function, astronauts develop increased reactivation of latent viruses, including herpes viruses (EBV, CMV, VZV)3,7,1215. In one study, viral shedding after 914 days of spaceflight was linked to changes in serum cytokines, including a preferential large increase in IL-4 compared to interferon (IFN)γ, indicating a possible shift away from Th1 immunity towards Th2 immunity16. Consistently, some astronauts report heightened hypersensitivity reactions, such as increased allergic and Th2-like responses in space7. Multiple studies using higher throughput approaches have started to add insight into pathways impacted by spaceflight. In the Twins study17, a one-year ISS mission altered innate, adaptive, and NK cell-mediated immunity across bulk RNA sequencing analysis. In T cells, increases in DNA methylation were seen in the promoters of notch3 for CD4 T cells, linked to T cell differentiation, and in scl1a5asct2, linked to activation, for CD8 T cells.",

          "text": "Long-duration spaceflights reportedly induce immune dysregulation, which is considered a risk to astronaut safety and mission success3. Studies to date have demonstrated the altered distribution of peripheral leukocytes, a diminished function of specific leukocyte subpopulations, and skewed cytokine profiles in many astronauts3. Many biomarkers associated with neuroinflammation following space radiation and space stressors in rodents and humans have been identified48. However, the precise nature of immune dysregulation during spaceflight is not well understood. Evidence suggests that acute exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) induce detrimental CNS changes including an increased level of neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and cognitive deficits similar to accelerated aging912. Ionizing radiation has been shown to elicit neuroinflammation through direct activation of microglia cells13 and through the increased infiltration of immune and inflammatory cells through the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB)14. Study also showed that both microgravity encountered by astronauts in space and simulated microgravity on earth induce changes in brain structure and function15. Microgravity induces a tremendous shift in body fluids, an increase in brain fluid and alterations in tissue perfusion16. Space microgravity modulates the expression of cellular molecules, and alters pro-inflammation cytokine secretion17.",

      "answer": "Microgravity has a significant influence on stem cell differentiation, particularly in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Studies indicate that when hMSCs are cultured in a microgravity environment, their differentiation is typically suppressed. This suppression allows some highly functional stem cells to maintain their undifferentiated and unaltered phenotypes, which is advantageous for their potential use in regenerative therapies . In microgravity conditions, specifically within microgravity-microsphere cultures, there is a selective proliferation of highly functional subpopulations of stem cells. These cells exhibit higher expression levels of pluripotent markers such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF, and CD34 compared to those cultured in traditional monolayer conditions. The upregulation of these markers is associated with enhanced self-renewal and proliferative capabilities, which are crucial for maintaining stem cell functionality . Moreover, the microgravity environment appears to play a key role in preserving the functionality of hASCs, as indicated by the lack of nuclear stem-cell marker upregulation in static microsphere cultures. This suggests that the dynamic conditions of microgravity may be essential for optimizing stem cell characteristics and their potential applications in regenerative medicine .",

          "text": "Among possible sources of stress, gravity may historically have been the most underappreciated microenvironment stress, because of its constant influence on cultured cells. Numerous studies have reported the impact of microgravity conditions on stem-cell proliferation [35] and differentiation [36,37]. Notably, human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in a microgravity environment usually demonstrate suppressed differentiation [38]. Therefore, some highly functional stem cells may be able to retain their undifferentiated, unaltered phenotypes if they can avoid the force of gravity during culture. According to previous studies, controlled rotation around two axes can minimize the cumulative gravity vector to an average of 103 g over time [24]. In our experimental system, although cells were attached to microsphere surfaces, the culture medium containing the microspheres was stirred by controlled rotation around two axes. As a result, the cells gravity vectors were randomly and continuously changing, with their final cumulative gravity vectors being minimized toward zero. Some microgravity-simulating devices have been developed [39,40], but they involve significant costs and are very difficult to standardize. Moreover, even such devices created large cell clusters which represent the limit of cell-proliferative capacity [25] and reinforce the advantage of the present adhesive conditions for the large-scale expansion of hASCs [41].",

          "text": "Human adipose-derived stem cells are normally capable of heterogeneous potency. Exposure to stress can selectively deplete regular stem cells, but does not increase the number of highly functional stem cells. In contrast, microgravitymicrosphere cultures can selectively cause the proliferation of highly functional cell subpopulations to reach the numbers required for regenerative therapies. Furthermore, hASCs harvested from microgravitymicrosphere cultures had higher expression levels of the pluripotent markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF, and CD34 compared to hASCs cultured in monolayers. OCT4 and NANOG are known to be involved in the self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells, while SOX2, MYC, and KLF expression act as transcription factors to control genes involved during embryonic development [19]. CD34 has been reported to contribute to the proliferative ability of hASCs both by us [23,45] and by others [46,47]. However, the upregulation of nuclear stem-cell markers was hardly detected in hASCs from static microsphere cultures, suggesting that the microgravity environment may play a key role in preserving hASC functionality. In a previous report, spaceflight experiments demonstrated that altered gene expression was associated with epigenetic changes, such as chromatin re-modeling and DNA methylation [48].",

          "text": "There is also no enhanced nutrient transport that accompanies clinorotation in our system. Without these confounding factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that the cell morphology differences we observed were predominantly due to changes in the angular frequency of clinorotation. We believe the rounding and retracted cell area of hMSCs in simulated microgravity inhibit migration in the presence of a chemical gradient. Interestingly, the kinetics of cell area changes during retraction were different from those during spreading, and were also angular frequency independent, suggesting that distinct gravisensing mechanisms may regulate different processes. Similarly, other cell processes, and even cell fate, could be affected.39 In the same way that microgravity may produce these cellular alterations, other mechanical stimuli and substrate characteristics can also modulate cell function.40 Stem cell morphology has a strong correlation with cellular phenotype and differentiation potential.41,42 It has been demonstrated in prior work that spread cells have a higher tendency to undergo osteogenesis and that cells with rounded morphologies are more susceptible to adipogenesis.42 Because of the short-term nature of this current study, it is not possible to establish whether hMSCs in our system would behave according to these trends.",

          "text": "This is particularly important because issues such as SANS can be experienced after as little as 34 days, and unusual pathologic neuro-ophthalmic findings have been shown after both short- and long-term space travel [2]. Many studies on the use of microgravity have been performed using an array of cells both committed to a specific phenotype depending on the organ of study as well as uncommitted cells known as stem cells. The origin of stem cells includes murine and human origin. Among these are adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), and organ-specific stem cells [3]. Recent publications have described changes in stem cells when exposed to simulated or space microgravity. Nonetheless, there is limited information in what concerns neural stem cells. Prior research looking at the effects of microgravity on neural stem cells has primarily been conducted with the use of simulated microgravity (sim-µG). Sim-µG studies use machines that are able to simulate low gravity conditions such as the Mitsubishi 3D-Clinostat [4]. The use of different microgravity platforms with application on stem cells and differentiated cells has recently been reviewed [3]. Only a few studies have shown the effect of sim-µG or SPC-µG specifically on neural stem cells.",

          "text": "In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions.",

          "text": "These results suggest that exposure to severe stress can concentrate SSEA-3() hASCs through the selective depletion of SSEA-3() cells, but such stress can also inhibit cell proliferation. Instead of concentration, microsphere cultures under microgravity conditions increased SSEA-3() hASCs by proliferation (Figure 9). In other words, the present microgravity culture conditions increased not only the proportion, but also the number, of SSEA-3() cells to actualize regenerative therapies requiring these highly therapeutic cells. However, a limitation of this study is that we only assessed SSEA-3 as a pluripotent marker in stress-exposure experiments. Additional research including analyses of the other pluripotent markers (e.g., Oct4 and Sox2) may further emphasize the differences between microgravity cultures and stress-exposure cultures, or reveal new characteristics of the two cultures. Schematic representation of the study. Human adipose-derived stem cells are normally capable of heterogeneous potency. Exposure to stress can selectively deplete regular stem cells, but does not increase the number of highly functional stem cells. In contrast, microgravitymicrosphere cultures can selectively cause the proliferation of highly functional cell subpopulations to reach the numbers required for regenerative therapies.",

          "text": "More recently, another study using a NASA-developed Rotating Wall Vessel, which was employed in our current work, utilized a 41-parameter mass cytometry approach to show that short-term (1822 hours) simulated microgravity can dampen NK cell, CD4, and CD8 T cell responses to Concanavalin Aanti-CD28 stimulation, but potentiates STAT5 signaling to boost Tregs18. Despite these important advances, the core fundamental mechanisms, genes, and pathways that are directly altered by microgravity to adversely impact immunity, including at single-cell resolution, are largely unknown. Interestingly, mechanical forces are emerging as critical orchestrators of immune cell function, whereby mechanotransduction tunes immune cell responsiveness to danger signals19. Some of these effects occur through environmental modulation of mechanosensing pathways that alter ion currents in cells, metabolism, or directly act on the cytoskeleton19. Thus, a spaceflight environment, which alters forces such as gravity, associated hydrostatic pressure, and shear force20,21 onto immune cells likely directly contributes to immune system dysfunction. Here, using a common ground-based analog, the NASA developed low shear modeled microgravity Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)2,18,22, we examine in depth how short-term (25 hours) exposure to simulated microgravity impacts the human peripheral blood mononuclear immune system in detail at single-cell resolution.",

          "text": "To simulate physiologically relevant ranges of mechanical loads in cell cultures, various strategies have been used including applying cyclic stretch [5], or pulses of hydrostatic pressure [6], and hypergravity (HG) [7], that often result in enhanced cellular proliferation and differentiation effects. In the unique environment of space, free fall-induced weightlessness can modulate the intrinsic factors of tissue mechanical environment leading to reduced mechanical loads in tissue niche environments [8]. Modeling the effects of microgravity on Earth has been attempted with a multitude of strategies; however, many of these strategies in an effort to replicate free fall, generate non-physiologic fluid shear and rotational loading to the cells [9]. The interesting observation that traditional static cell culture plating results in pressure loading well below the physiologically relevant range may provide a unique path for cellular level modeling of the microgravity free fall environment. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are primary stem cells that can be turned toward specific fates by exclusive modulation of mechanical environment [10,11]. However, these methods often induce ESC differentiation to a single cell type, removing the cultures from physiologic relevance.",

      "answer": "Prolonged space missions can lead to several neurological effects, primarily due to the unique conditions of microgravity and exposure to various environmental stressors. Key findings include: 1. **Structural Changes in the Brain**: - **White Matter Disruption**: Research has observed white structural disruption in areas critical for visuo-motor control and higher-order visuo-spatial processing following spaceflight. Some studies reported increases in white matter immediately after spaceflight that persisted for up to seven months post-return to Earth . - **Ventricular Volume Expansion**: Significant expansions in ventricular volume have been documented, which did not return to preflight levels even six months to one year after landing . 2. **Cortical Changes**: - There are widespread reductions in cortical deactivation in somatosensory and visual areas associated with postural balance decline after spaceflight. Changes in cortical thickness in vestibular and sensorimotor regions, such as the posterior insula and superior temporal gyrus, have been linked to postural balance performance . 3. **Behavioral and Cognitive Implications**: - The implications of these neurological changes on human performance and behavior remain unclear. While some robust effects have been noted in postural control, the effects on cognitive performance are less well-defined. Data collected during missions often show stability or even performance increases, despite the presence of specific stressors like sleep deprivation and hypoxia . Overall, the interplay between these neurological changes and their behavioral implications is an area of ongoing research, with many aspects still not fully understood.",

          "text": "The potential damage to neural structures in response to spaceflight and its behavioral implications are not well understood. At the same time adverse behavioral conditions, psychiatric disorders, and sensorimotor deficits are considered some of the most serious but also least understood risks during future long-duration space missions. Many other spaceflight risks are ranked lower or have been mitigated. In addition to the physiological effects of microgravity, the spacecraft setting can involve exposure to multiple environmental toxicants and operational stressors1 that all have the potential to affect neurobehavioral performance (Fig. 1). Behavioral health and performance are governed by an interplay between the central nervous system (CNS), the environment and individual phenotypes that is characterized by constantly updating and balancing genetic, molecular, cellular, physiological and cognitive demands and resources. The CNS, and particularly the brain, have emerged as a pivotal area of research because of their vulnerability to various spaceflight stressors. There is increasing evidence that spaceflight is associated with various adaptations of the brain, including intracranial fluid shifts, gray matter changes, white matter declines, and sensory reweighting and neural compensation2. However, the exact changes in brain structure and function and their meaning and mechanisms, as well as the role of mission duration, sex, and phenotypic vulnerabilities are unknown.",

          "text": "Such effects could have a profound impact on operator proficiency such as controling a vehicle during the exploration of novel terrains, or performing rendezvous and docking maneuvers. It may also be possible that certain effects are delayed, and are only detected after weeks to months. For example, the NASA Twin Study showed that year-long human spaceflight does not immediately affect cognitive performance but reveals some adverse effects 6 months after return to Earth20. The temporal dynamics of cognitive performance trajectories during and after spaceflight are still to be explored. Along the same lines it is unclear whether there is a dose-response relationship between neurobehavioral adaptations and mission duration. It is therefore critical that future studies will go beyond 6-month duration missions, and consider following up space crews throughout the recovery of plus one year. Previous cognitive assessments also seem to have been driven by classical neuropsychological test paradigms. It is possible that spaceflight would benefit from more complex tasks that are specifically targeted to the astronaut population, and capture cognitive domains associated with visuo-spatial processing that are expected to be tightly coupled with operational tasks5,6. Moreover, it is expected that such tasks could be relevantly affected by gravitational changes because its close link to the vestibular system, which goes beyond maintaining gaze and balance.",

While various neurobehavioral effects have been observed in response to specific spaceflight stressors (e.g., sleep deprivation, hypoxia, hypercapnia and irradiation), most data collected during spaceflight show stability, or performance increases throughout the mission17,18. The inconclusive findings can at least somewhat be attributed to study designs and methodological limitations such as mission duration, the type of tasks to assess cognitive performance, and the number and spacing of data sampling time points. For instance, Moore and colleagues (2019) observed significant impairments in manual dexterity, degradation in manual tracking, during dual tasking, and a car driving simulator task immediately upon return from space19. Notably, the effects recovered quickly (35 days post-landing), and the authors attributed their findings to post-flight blunting in low-frequency (tilt) otolith function in addition to fatigue and environmental factors unique to prolonged stays in a spacecraft (e.g., increased CO2 levels, altered daynight cycles, high workload, confined space)19. Such effects could have a profound impact on operator proficiency such as controling a vehicle during the exploration of novel terrains, or performing rendezvous and docking maneuvers. It may also be possible that certain effects are delayed, and are only detected after weeks to months.",

          "text": "Astronauts in spaceflight experience impairments in neurocognition (as measured by altered decision making and problem solving) and neurobehavior (as measured by impaired visual perceptions, motor controls and sleepwake cycles) [5]. The NASA Twins study offers some additional insight into post-flight cognitive decline that persists up to 6 months post-flight (end of experimental sampling) [6]. Longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected from astronauts pre- and post-flight (shuttle missions 30 days and ISS mission 200 days) revealed whole brain shifting within the skull and white matter disruptions, suggesting spaceflight leads to long-term alterations of brain structure in humans [7]. Rodent models offer an appropriate alternative to assess the effects of spaceflight-like conditions on brain tissue. Recently, the Rodent Research (RR)-1 mission flew mice to the International Space Station (ISS) for 33 days and measured neurobehavioral outcomes through video monitoring, which indicated 16-week old (at launch) females displayed unique group hyperactivity behavior at 2 weeks post-launch, implying neurological disruptions occur in flight [8]. Moreover, long-term readaptation to chronic LDR and hindlimb unloading (HLU) (a ground-based analog of spaceflight) resulted in increased aquaporin-4 (AQP4) protein expression, oxidative stress damage, apoptosis, bloodbrain barrier (BBB) compromise and an increase in neurobehavioral risk-taking behavior [9,10,11].",

          "text": "Here, authors show region-specific spaceflight-induced alterations in processes of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission. In preparation for long-duration lunar and Mars missions, it is crucial to investigate the health risks to astronauts that are posed by exposure to the space environment1. The key physiological impairments include DNA damage and oxidative stress from galactic cosmic radiation2, bone and muscle damage from loss of gravity3,4, circadian and sleep dysregulation5, microbial dysbiosis6 and tissue and organ degeneration, including cardiovascular and CNS damage7. Studies on animal models have shown several spaceflight stressors directly impacting brain molecular mechanisms causing neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and neurovascular damage811. Specifically, exposure to simulated space radiation at doses comparable to the ones expected during the planned Mars mission, leads to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in vivo and in tissue and cell models12, as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits in rodent models. Furthermore, major physiological effects of microgravity in low-Earth orbit, as observed at the International Space Station (ISS), include a redistribution of body fluids from lower towards upper body parts, leading to significant cardiovascular13 and CNS changes14. However, deeper investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms and specificity of these impairments, and identify targets for countermeasure development.",

          "text": "According to the fluid shift theory, this increased pressure is the root of space motion sickness, a set of symptoms that impair operational performance of 6080 of astronauts. Additional interconnected abnormalities include morphological changes in the white and grey matter of the brain following long-duration spaceflight (average of 171 days), which have been attributed to the structural neuroplasticity of the sensorimotor system, in an effort to adapt motor strategies to maintain physiological homeostasis and ensure proper behavioral output in space [3]. Lack of gravitational loading also results in muscle atrophy, especially in the lower extremities, accompanied by functional and structural alterations. While muscular loss has been linked to reduced muscular activity and hypokinesia due to limited movement inside the spacecraft, structural changes seem to be related to both a higher level of muscle protein degradation enzymes and a decrease in protein synthesis [59]. Extended exposure to microgravity also results in bone loss due to insufficient bone formation compared with bone resorption, and this reduction in bone mass and strength during spaceflight increases the risk of bone fracture, even upon return to Earth [62]. As reported for radiation, similarities have been observed between the adaptive response to microgravity in humans and aging, since both prompt the decline of almost every body system [5].",

          "text": "Despite microgravity being the major difference experienced by space-flown animals compared to ground control animals, we cannot exclude other environmental factors (e.g. radiation) as partially responsible for the observed phenotypes. The impact of these changes to neuronal function remains in question; however, our results raise the intriguing possibility that long-duration spaceflights may affect brain function due to neuronal morphological remodeling and deficits in waste degradation. Interestingly, the recent National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) twins study found that the twin astronaut that spent 1 year onboard the ISS exhibited post-flight decline in cognitive performance when compared to his identical brother who remained on Earth (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Future missions will need to carefully address the impact of spaceflight on overall brain structure and function to properly assess the risks of long-duration missions planned for the medium future to take humans to Mars and beyond. Our study reveals how spaceflight can affect adult neuronal morphology and the response to extruded neuronal waste. However, we were unable to mechanistically dissect these phenotypes given the inability to send new samples to the ISS on a regular basis. Future missions will be essential to clarify how consistent these adaptations to spaceflight are and to further explore the molecular, cellular, and tissue responses to spaceflight.

      "answer": "Weightlessness, or microgravity, significantly affects bone remodeling in astronauts by disrupting the balance between bone resorption and bone formation. Post-flight measurements indicate that there is an exponential decrease in bone resorption markers, while bone formation markers increase linearly. This imbalance leads to a state of bone homeostasis that is out of equilibrium during and after spaceflight . Specifically, trabecular bone, which is crucial for metabolic processes associated with bone turnover, experiences reductions in density following spaceflight. This compromised trabecular structure can lead to irreversible damage to bone integrity . One hypothesis for the observed region-specific bone loss is the alteration in mechanical loading conditions due to microgravity. High mechanical loading zones, which are essential for maintaining bone density, are reduced to low mechanical loading conditions in microgravity, potentially leading to decreased bone formation in those areas . Countermeasures such as extensive resistive exercise regimes have been implemented to stimulate mechanical loading and mitigate bone loss; however, these interventions have not fully reversed the bone loss process . Additionally, research using human bed-rest as a model for microgravity has shown that the greatest bone loss occurs in weight-bearing bones of the lower body, including the lumbar spine, femur, tibia, and calcaneus, which aligns with findings from astronauts . Notably, astronauts continue to experience bone loss after returning to Earth, with some not fully recovering even after five years, indicating a significant risk of fractures due to diminished bone strength . In summary, weightlessness leads to a detrimental imbalance in bone remodeling, particularly affecting weight-bearing bones, and poses long-term risks for astronauts' skeletal health.",

          "text": "Post-flight measurements showed exponential decreases in bone resorption markers, but only a linear increase in bone formation markers, keeping bone homeostasis out of equilibrium during and post flight [345,357,358,359,362,363]. Furthermore, trabecular bone, the sponge-like structure at the epiphyses of long bones involved in metabolic processes associated with bone turnover, was also reduced post-flight [364,365,366]. Compromised trabeculae can irreversibly damage bone structure altogether [367,368]. One hypothesis contributing to region-specific bone loss during spaceflight is the changes in mechanical loading induced by microgravity [369,370]. High mechanical loading zones are reduced to low mechanical loading in microgravity and may therefore also reduce bone for the lack of necessity in that region. Extensive resistive exercise regimes have been employed in astronauts to stimulate mechanical loading to these areas that have shown to reduce bone loss, but do not ameliorate the bone loss process [342,345,365,371,372,373]. It has also been pointed out by Stanichuk et al. that bone density changes were also found in areas of neutral mechanical loading such as the skull, suggesting that microgravity-induced changes in mechanical loading may not be the sole contributor to bone changes during spaceflight [345].",

          "text": "Some of these crewmembers continue to lose bone after returning to Earth, and those who experience the greatest bone decrements do not fully recover even after five years [7]. The correlation between bone loss and diminishing bone strength suggests a significant risk of fractures for astronauts [8, 9, 10]. Development of countermeasures against the osteopenic effect of space travel requires a better understanding of bone adaptation. Human bed-rest is a method used to simulate microgravity without spaceflight. Using this technique, LeBlanc and team demonstrate the greatest bone loss in weight-bearing bones of the lower body, notably the lumbar spine, femur, tibia and the calcaneus [11]. A 60-day bed-rest study reports the greatest loss at the proximal femur and distal tibia [12]. These results are consistent with bone changes induced by spaceflight. Bone measurements on Skylab astronauts show increasing mineral loss in the os calcis corresponding to the length of the mission [4]. A more comprehensive comparison between 18 cosmonauts and bed-rest subjects supports that spaceflight produces similar, if not greater, mineral loss in weight-bearing bones than bed-rest [5]. Bones of the upper limbs are minimally impacted, and increases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the skull are observed [4, 11, 13]. To date, musculoskeletal research on physiological adaptations to microgravity focuses on weight-bearing regions of the lower body.",

          "text": "Since normal tissue repair and regeneration is dependent on the ability of adult stem cells to proliferate and differentiate, we have hypothesized that during long-term spaceflight, the reduction in gravity mechano-stimulation may decrease regenerative proliferation and differentiation of tissue-specific adult stem cells. This in turn may have significant health consequences for multiple tissues throughout the body, including bone. Specifically for bone tissue, short-duration exposure to microgravity rapidly leads to alterations in bone mineral content, cellular dynamics, and gene expression patterns [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. This is illustrated by a 12 loss of skeletal mineral in weight-bearing bones per month [17], which poses significant risks for long-duration and interplanetary missions. Because bone remodeling homeostasis depends on tightly coupled mineral deposition and resorption [20], [21], uncoupling of these processes in microgravity can cause increased and rapid bone resorption by osteoclasts, and decreased bone formation by osteoblasts [17], [18], [22], [23]. Increased osteoclast bone resorptive activity has been documented within the first several days of spaceflight [1], [17] and may be reduced after a period of transition and adaptation to microgravity.",

The same principle may be used to explain the remodeling of calvariae in space. Normally weight-bearing bones such as in the lumbar spine decrease in mineral density in spaceflight or simulated microgravity, while bones that do not bear weight such as the skull show increased BMD [25]. The majority of studies that have been conducted to determine the physiological consequences of microgravity discuss the changes specifically in bones that normally bear weight. A study analyzing effects of long-duration spaceflight missions (average length of 176 45 days) shows substantial reductions in bone mineral density in several weight-bearing bones including the lumbar spine and leg, resulting in a total body BMD decrease of 0.35month [19]. The proposed mechanism for this is an uncoupling of normal bone remodeling with increasing bone resorption without compensatory bone formation [26]. It is possible that staying in microgravity for longer duration will results in more significant changes in the skull. Analyzing calvariae of spaceflight mice allows the comparison with similar studies that use simulated microgravity conditions.",

          "text": "These findings have made bone loss treatment and prevention a high priority for astronaut health and safety. Bones undergo modeling during development and remodeling in later stages of life to form, replace, and remove bone [347]. Osteoblasts are derived from stromal cells of the bone marrow and are responsible for bone formation [348]. In contrast, osteoclasts that derive from the hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, resorb bone during remodeling, making the equilibrium between the bone forming osteoblast and bone resorbing osteoclast vital to overall bone homeostasis [349,350]. Bone formation and resorption can be biochemically measured in the urine through quantification of proteins produced during formation, such as bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, as well as peptides released during matrix degradation, such as hydoxyproline, collagen type I, pyridinoline, and deoxypyridinoline [345,351,352]. These biochemical assays have been conducted on astronaut urine before, during, and after spaceflight to reveal that bone resorption markers heavily increase during spaceflight with only a slow increase in bone formation markers [345,353,354,355,356,357,358,359,360,361,362]. Post-flight measurements showed exponential decreases in bone resorption markers, but only a linear increase in bone formation markers, keeping bone homeostasis out of equilibrium during and post flight [345,357,358,359,362,363].",

          "text": "Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL6J mice (n  8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BVTV) of 6.29, and bone thickness of 11.91. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170 (p  0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (17, p  0.022), perimeter (14, p  0.008), and canalicular diameter (6, p  0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (12.94, 2.98 and 16.85 fold respectively, p0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1ap21 in bone increased 3.",

          "text": "Bones of the upper limbs are minimally impacted, and increases in bone mineral density (BMD) of the skull are observed [4, 11, 13]. To date, musculoskeletal research on physiological adaptations to microgravity focuses on weight-bearing regions of the lower body. While modest effort is made to study remodeling of partially-loaded bones (ie: the upper appendages) in response to weightlessness, data on non-loaded bones are scarce and are generated mostly from bed-rest and rodent hind-limb unloading studies. Studies of extended bed-rest and lower-body disuse demonstrate patterns of increased BMD in skull bones along with mineral loss in bones of the lower axial and appendicular skeleton [11, 13, 14, 15]. In their simulated weightlessness experiment, Roer and Dillaman found heavier dry and ash weights of the skulls from hindlimb-suspended rats [16]. However, it is unclear whether the observed adaptations of unloaded bones to inactivity and simulated microgravity reflect the remodeling of these bones in actual microgravity. The present paper attempts to quantify the adaptations of cranial bones to spaceflight. Specifically, our goals are to evaluate the remodeling of skull bones due to actual microgravity, to compare the adaptation of non-loaded bones to actual microgravity versus simulated microgravity as reported in literature, and to quantify these changes based on mineral content and bone volume.",

          "text": "This increased remodeling may have led to the measured decrease in carbonate content, an indication of younger bone matrix (26). Although not apparent in the tendon enthesis mechanics of the current study, these changes in carbonate content can affect the size, structure, solubility, and mechanics of bone mineral crystals (31), leading to increased stiffness and decreased toughness (11). The increase in osteoclastogenesis-associated genes in addition to the increase in bone formation genes suggests that there is increased remodeling or bone turnover but not necessarily an increase in bone resorption. The trabecular structure of the humeral head remained unchanged with both 2 and 4 weeks of spaceflight. This was unexpected, as microgravity is generally associated with bone loss. For the missions included in the current study, others reported decreases in BVTV in the pelvis and mandibles of STS-131 animals (25, 32) as well as the vertebrae and femurs of the Bion-M1 animals (33, 34). Importantly, there is extensive evidence showing that bone loss with unloading varies dramatically with respect to anatomic site. For example, the femur, pelvis, and spine exhibit the highest levels of bone loss in unloading and spaceflight experiments (35, 36). Bones located at the extremities undergo less bone loss and sometimes even bone formation (36). For example, the BVTV of the cranium and mandible increased in STS-131 and STS-135 respectively (37, 38).",

      "answer": "In space-exposed organisms, significant alterations in protein expression have been observed, particularly concerning ribosomal subunit proteins, spliceosomes, and proteasomes. These changes indicate major adaptations in the transcriptional and translational machinery of plants, as evidenced by the varied abundance of over 150 ribosomal subunit proteins and other related components in spaceflight conditions . 1. **Decreased mRNA Splicing**: There is a noted decrease in the abundance of various mRNA splicing factors (e.g., ATO, CUV, SC35, SCL30A, U2AF65A, U2AF65B, DEAH3) in the shoot compared to the root during spaceflight. This reduction may lead to an accumulation of non-functional proteins in the shoot, necessitating increased proteasome activity to manage these misfolded proteins . 2. **Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)**: The abundance of heat shock protein families (HS60, HSP70, HSP90) is elevated in both organs during spaceflight. This suggests an enhanced control of protein homeostasis, which includes the proper folding of nascent polypeptides and the sorting of proteins to organelles. The increased presence of 26S proteasomes indicates a response to errors in protein translation, highlighting the need for efficient degradation mechanisms for misfolded proteins . 3. **Response to Infection**: In ground controls, infection led to changes in the expression of proteins involved in various functions, including heat shock protein folding. Notably, the heat shock protein HSPA1A was upregulated during infection in ground cultures but not in flight, likely due to its pre-existing elevated levels (2.4-fold) in spaceflight conditions. This suggests that spaceflight may prime cells with sufficient HSPA1A for stress responses, indicating a unique adaptation to the space environment . Overall, these findings illustrate that spaceflight induces complex changes in protein expression, affecting both the stress response and the overall protein synthesis and degradation pathways in organisms.",

          "text": "The varied abundance of over 150 ribosomal subunit proteins, spliceosomes and proteasomes in spaceflight and across both organs suggest major alterations to plant transcriptional and translation machinery as an adaptation mechanism to the spaceflight environment ( Supplementary Tables E, F ). The decreased abundance of various mRNA slicing factors (ATO, CUV, SC35, SCL30A, U2AF65A, U2AF65B, DEAH3) in the shoot in spaceflight suggests less mRNA splicing in the shoot compared to the root, which might lead to the abundance of non-functional proteins in the shoot and increased need for proteasome activities. Combining transcript data with this proteome data will give more insight into this. The abundance of HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN families (HS60, HSP70, HSP90) in both organs suggests an increased control of protein homeostasis in space characterized by folding of nascent polypeptides released from the ribosome, sorting of proteins to cell organelles and providing a link to the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. The relative abundance of 26S proteasomes involved in the degradation of misfolded and orphaned proteins suggests that the spaceflight environment led to errors in protein translation, hence the need to increase the efficiency of the proteasome unit. Seedlings in spaceflight are faced with the need to maintain a balance between the abundance of ROS for systemic stress signaling and their damaging effects.",

          "text": "Spaceflight is known to alter the organization andor expression of structural proteins14,20,21. Infection in ground controls induced changes in the expression of proteins with various functions, including heat shockprotein folding, RNA-binding, calcium-sensing, and disulfide bond catalysis (Supplementary Table 3). Heat shock protein HSPA1A was upregulated during infection in ground cultures but not in response to infection in flight. This difference between the flight and ground infections could possibly be attributed to the fact that the protein was already 2.4-fold upregulated in flight even in the absence of infection (see uninfected flight vs. ground comparison in Supplementary Table 3). Thus, the flight-cultured cells may have had sufficient amounts of HSPA1A protein readily available for response to infection. HSPA1A is a major stress-inducible member of the HSP70 family and can be upregulated as part of a cytoprotective response to a variety of stressors, including infection71. Heat shock proteins have previously shown altered expression (RNA and protein) in a variety of mammalian, plant, and prokaryotic cells during spaceflight or spaceflight analog culture, though not in a unified direction72, which is not surprising given their diverse functions. For example, multiple HSP70 transcripts were upregulated during BRIC-16, an Arabidopsis thaliana tissue culture payload aboard STS-131 (the same Shuttle mission as the present study)72.",

          "text": "Two cell wallassociated lipid transfer proteins are also differentially represented in the differential spaceflight proteome (light gray highlight in Fig. 6). There is strong representation of cell wall peroxidases (green highlight in Fig. 6) (e.g., Bellincampi et al., 2014) and cell wall lectins (brown highlight in Fig. 6) (e.g., Kauss and Glaser 1974; Albenne et al., 2009) in the network, connecting key metabolism, stress response, and cell expansion activities in the network of proteins differentially regulated by spaceflight. There are also a number of proteins that are connected by a domain of unknown function (DUF) deeply involved in cell wall metabolism (lower left in Fig. 6) (e.g., Garza-Caligaris et al., 2012; Vazquez-Lobo et al., 2012). These proteomics studies offered an initial opportunity to potentially integrate information on spaceflight responses at the protein and mRNA levels in that these samples were derived from very similar grow-outs on the ISS to the transcriptomics studies of Paul et al. (2013). A direct comparison of differential protein levels and their corresponding transcript expression levels does show some correlation. However, only a small portion of the differential transcripts are represented in the differential protein levels, and vice versa. This is, however, in agreement with previous studies in yeast (Futcher et al., 1999; Gygi et al., 1999; Washburn et al., 2003), mice (Tian et al., 2004), Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Nie et al., 2006), E.",

          "text": "Among the genes with upregulated expression, some of them constitute the ribosomal complex within plastids, and some others were genes involved in electron transport chains located within mitochondria and representative for ATP biosynthesis. Among the downregulated genes the largest group was shown to code for HSPs. These results indicated that 5 days of exposure to microgravity did not cause detectable significant changes in gene expression, but caused an increased energy demand which should be taken into consideration when plants will be used as part of bioregenerative supports on long duration space missions. Finally, with the aim to separate responses to microgravity from those of non-microgravity-related spaceflight conditions, genes that were significantly altered within spaceflight samples (FS and FC) compared to the 1g ground control were studied. The majority of these genes were involved in the stress-induced antioxidant system, signaling chains, and defense-resistance response. The alteration of these processes was assumed as the effect of spaceflight-related environmental conditions, and especially, with the high radiation dose received by space samples (0.51 mSVd), much more intense than terrestrial levels of radiation (1 to 2 mSVa) (Fengler et al., 2015).",

See also Table S2. The aforementioned BRIC-16-DNA experiment also included the transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana tissue culture cells (Paul et al., 2012)(Table 4). One of the most striking molecular differences observed was the significant increase in expression of most heat shock proteins (HSP) and heat shock factor (HSF) transcriptional activators genes in spaceflight non-differentiated tissue culture cells. Among these genes, the HsfA2 transcription factor which is involved in the late phases of heat stress response, and two of its targets: Hsp17.6A, that blocks protein aggregation, and Hsp101, that facilitates dissociation of already formed protein aggregates.",

          "text": "Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.

          "text": "Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.

          "text": "However, only a small portion of the differential transcripts are represented in the differential protein levels, and vice versa. This is, however, in agreement with previous studies in yeast (Futcher et al., 1999; Gygi et al., 1999; Washburn et al., 2003), mice (Tian et al., 2004), Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Nie et al., 2006), E. coli (Ishihama et al., 2005), Tragopogon (Koh et al., 2012), and cotton (Hu et al., 2013), showing that transcript abundances only partially predict protein abundances and that a series of regulatory processes involved in translation, localization, modification, and protein degradation play a substantial role in controlling protein expression (Vogel and Marcotte, 2012). Nonetheless, conclusions based on the proteomics and transcriptomics levels closely interrelate when examining protein name or function as opposed to strict TAIR accession number. The exact same geneprotein may not be represented in the corresponding transcriptome, yet the differential proteome from these samples displays a similar engagement of cell wall remodeling tools in response to spaceflight as seen in the transcriptome from similar samples. Roots and leaves adapt differently to spaceflight at the level of proteomics. While there are some commonalities among the spaceflight proteome changes in roots and leaves, such as cell wall metabolism, the present data indicate that roots and leaves invoke differential proteome responses to spaceflight.",

      "answer": "Microgravity exposure significantly impacts mitochondrial function, leading to alterations in mitochondrial activity and bioenergetics. Key findings include: 1. **Mitochondrial Stress**: Research indicates that spaceflight induces mitochondrial stress across various organisms, including humans. This is evidenced by transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, and metabolomic patterns consistent with mitochondrial stress in muscle tissues and other organs. Specifically, studies involving mouse data from the International Space Station (ISS), astronaut studies, and the NASA Twin Study have shown alterations in the electron transport chain and ATP production in mitochondria during spaceflight . 2. **Decreased Mitochondrial Activity**: In plant studies, such as those involving space-flown soybean seedlings, decreased mitochondrial activity has been reported, suggesting that microgravity affects mitochondrial function across different species . 3. **Protein Adaptations**: Microgravity exposure may lead to specific adaptations in mitochondrial proteins that affect skeletal muscle tissue. For instance, changes in the activity of enzymes such as 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase have been noted, indicating that the bioenergetics adaptations in skeletal muscle may differ from those in cardiac muscle . 4. **Impact on ATP Synthesis**: The lower diffusion rates of solutes in microgravity reduce the hydrogen gradient at the mitochondrial intermembrane space, which in turn diminishes electron transport chain activity and ATP synthesis . 5. **Oxidative Stress Indicators**: Increased levels of urinary 8-OHdG, a biomarker of oxidative stress related to DNA repair, have been observed, further supporting the notion that microgravity induces cellular stress, including mitochondrial dysfunction . In summary, microgravity leads to mitochondrial stress, decreased activity, specific protein adaptations, and impacts ATP synthesis, which collectively contribute to the physiological changes observed in astronauts and other organisms during spaceflight.",

          "text": "We are not the first to propose changes to mitochondrial activity during spaceflight. Nikawa and collaborators proposed a spaceflight-specific, induced mitochondrial activity alteration associated with muscle atrophy in 2004 (Nikawa et al., 2004). Another study reported decreased mitochondrial activity in the roots of space-flown soybean seedlings (Klimchuk, 2007). Low doses of radiation trigger severe mitochondrial damage (Shimura et al., 2016) and the lower diffusion rates of solutes in microgravity (Smith et al., 2009) reduce the hydrogen gradient at the mitochondrial intermembrane space, reducing electron transport chain and ATP synthesis (Nelson, 2013). Our findings report transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, and metabolomic patterns (Figs. 2 and 3) consistent with mitochondrial stress in different cells and multiple organs, including muscle tissues (Jha et al., 2017; Topf et al., 2019). Specifically, mouse ISS data (Fig. 3B), astronaut studies (Fig. 3F), and the NASA Twin Study data (Fig. 3E) all strongly support an alteration in the electron transport chain reaction and ATP production in the mitochondria. Taken as a body of evidence, this suggests spaceflight induces mitochondrial stress in multiple organisms. The existence of spaceflight-induced mitochondrial stress is further supported by metabolite studies reporting increased urinary 8-OHdG and prostaglandin F2 alpha. 8-OHdG is a biomarker of cellular oxidative stress related to DNA repair (Wu et al., 2004).",

It is noteworthy that tissues might respond differently to microgravity and the mitochondrial bioenergetics adaptations seen in skeletal muscle may be different from the ones seen in cardiac muscle; however new sequencing data may provide an insight into these differences18,75. Thus, using data from multiple tissues and time points begins to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of frailty in response to spaceflight. Importantly, our results demonstrate that these approaches can be employed directly in astronauts andor in combination with model systems. Muscle decline is another conserved feature between spaceflight and aging. It is also thought to contribute to frailty. Recently, functional measures of muscle decline with age have been well correlated with evolutionarily conserved gene expression changes with age27,74. In humans, changes in metabolic gene expression appear to occur prior to changes in inflammatory gene expression, suggesting that aging human muscle undergoes metabolic remodeling prior to becoming inflamed and sarcopenicalso highlighting the importance of temporaldynamic data71.",

          "text": "The field of nutritional mitochondrial therapeutics is still evolving, with some evidence pointing to effective treatments (Camp et al., 2016; Rinninella et al., 2018). The strongest candidate is the coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) that should be administered to the majority of primary mitochondrial diseases (PMD), independent of CoQ10 deficiency (Camp et al., 2016). CoQ10 is an abundant lipid-soluble nutrient scavenging free radical and protecting cells against oxidative damage (Zhang et al., 2018). CoQ10 is currently being tested on the ISS as a countermeasure for retinal lesions, and data from this project could help elucidate if CoQ10 could be used as a more general intervention (Lulli et al., 2019). In summary, the effects of spaceflight on the mitochondria provides a unifying framework for integrating the various alterations observed in the astronauts. Reduced mitochondrial function with sustained calories would generate excess mitochondrial ROS and activate compensatory mtDNA replication, resulting in increased mtDNA transcripts. The combination of replicating mtDNA and ROS would oxidize the mtDNA, which would be released to activate the innate immune system inflammasome and the Type I interferon pathway (West and Shadel, 2017; Zhong et al., 2018). The reduced NADH and radiation-induced DNA damage would reduce NAD levels (Fig. 3G), which would impair the circadian rhythm system through perturbed Sirt1 regulation of BMAL acetylation (Nakahata et al., 2008).",

          "text": "Limited knowledge exists for the effects of spaceflight on platelets (Vernice et al., 2020). However, mitochondrial dysfunction attenuates platelet survival and increased risk for thrombovascular events (Kunz et al., 2017; Melchinger et al., 2019), increasing stroke risk (Behrouzi and Punter, 2018). Mitochondrial dysfunction may cause stroke-like episodes independent of hypoxia (Ng et al., 2019). Therefore, spaceflight-induced mitochondrial dysfunction could increase cardiovascular disease risk in long-term missions caused by microgravity cardiovascular deconditioning and space radiation (Hughson et al., 2018). Cardiovascular disease is also linked to mitochondrial dysfunction through proteostasis failure related to lipid accumulation and ROS activity (Alam et al., 2020; Arrieta et al., 2020). Alterations in ribosome assembly, mitochondrial, and cytosol translation pathway in the cell models, internal organs, and muscles (Figs. 2 and 3) suggest the presence of proteostasis failure (Lu and Guo, 2020). Proteostasis refers to the maintenance of the proteome homeostasis by protein synthesis, folding, and degradation. Proteostasis failure occurs in C. elegans in response to spaceflight, although it was not clear if this response was due only to muscle wasting (Honda et al., 2012). Alterations in proteostasis were widespread in our cell models and internal organ tissues (Fig. 2).",

Alteration in mitochondrial protein production would activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (Fig. 7A), which would trigger the integrated stress response pathway (Fig. 3C), causing phosphorylation of the cytosolic initiation factor eIF2α. This would activate the ATF4 transcription factor to upregulate expression of FGF21 and GDF15 and induce the mitochondrial supercomplex assembly factor SCAF1 (Balsa et al., 2019a; Khan et al., 2017a). Finally, inhibiting the electron transport chain (Fig. 3G) would alter the mitochondrial metabolites, which serve as the substrates for the epigenome modification enzymes (Kopinski et al., 2019). Overall, this work highlights the power of comparing and integrating multiple omics and data types to understand further how life adapts to spaceflight conditions and risks. We found mitochondrial dysregulation as a central hub for space biology. This concept can guide new nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions and studies that will increase the viability of long-term human-crewed space missions. Health effects from mitochondrial dysfunction should be considered with spaceflight health risk models when planning future human-crewed missions to the Moon and Mars.",

          "text": "Additionally, simulated microgravity increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in multiple cell types [3,4] and elevated pro-inflammatory signaling [5,6]. Sources of ROS that have been demonstrated to contribute to unloading-induced muscle atrophy include the mitochondria [7] and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2) [8,9]. Indeed, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to skeletal muscle wasting with denervation [10,11], unloading [7], and cachexia [12,13,14]. Thus, there is a glaring need for preventative measures to maintain skeletal muscle health in astronauts enduring microgravity during their journeys to space. Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that respond to alterations in mechanical loading [15]. Increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and insufficient levels of stress proteins are proposed cellular mechanisms by which unloading causes pathology and impairment in musculoskeletal function. Mitochondrial ROS also appears to contribute to unloading-induced atrophy [7]. Mitochondria have many essential cellular roles, including mitochondrias well known, essential function in energy production. Oxidative energy production in mitochondria is accomplished through enzymatic pathways in the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC). Oxidative enzymes, such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), as well as substrate flux through the ETC, are important markers of metabolism adversely affected by unloading and spaceflight [16,17].",

          "text": "Our data support a hypothetical model where microgravity alters forces sensed by immune cells, leading to changes in the actin cytoskeleton, and nuclear receptor signaling, coupled to changes in core pathways in space such as mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Recent work in other cells, such as endothelial cells, has identified cytoskeletal abnormalities as a key feature of simulated microgravity that drives autophagy and a reduction in mitochondrial mass after 72 hours of exposure35. Our datasets would support some of these findings. Combined, these pathways would contribute to reduced oxidative phosphorylation and associated basal inflammatory processes, as well as reduced viral sensing pathways, associated reduced interferon responses and altered pyroptosis capability. Reduced interferon responses and signaling, impact both innate cells like monocytes and NK cells, as well as adaptive cells like T cells. Such changes could cumulate in viral or mycobacterial reactivation in microgravity. These processes would also be complemented by the psychological and physiological stresses of spaceflight, which also may independently associate with viral reactivation12,14,58. Thus, an important future direction of research is to address whether altered cytoskeleton, or associated reductions in interferon related gene products, including GBPs, are actively driving the reactivation of mycobacteria and latent viruses that we see in simulated microgravity.",

          "text": "Circadian misalignment, as a result from irregular light cues in spaceflight, can cause deviations from normal cycling and may have profound impacts on multiple physiological systems83. In line with this, circadian misalignment may innately impact immune function. Indeed, there have been reports describing cell-autonomous clock gene expressions in rat natural killer cells84 and mouse peritoneal macrophages85. Notably, in the absence of the core clock component protein cryptochrome (CRY), elevated proinflammatory cytokine expression mediated through NF-κB activation has been reported86. Further as mentioned above, neuroendocrine hormone release is regulated by the circadian system. For example, glucocorticoid release peaks in the early morning in response to light (diurnal), which integrates with cyclic systemic immunity (reviewed in87), suggesting neuroendocrine system crosstalk with immunity. Indeed, glucocorticoids can also directly impact macrophage polarization phenotypes, indirectly linking immune regulation to circadian cycling88. Therefore, modulation of glucocorticoid production that aligns with circadian cycle regulation in astronauts on deep space missions should be considered in countermeasure designs. Furthermore, diurnal sample collection metadata should also be evaluated during immune response analysis and considered for future experimental design.",

          "text": "In this regard, a depressed immune system in astronauts can potentially increase the incidence of infection, acute and chronic inflammation, and potentially carcinogenesis, while an enhanced immune response is associated with allergies and autoimmune diseases [133] [134]. Therefore, in combination with the greater virulence of pathogens in space [135], immune system dysfunction is of major concern for the expansion of human presence beyond Earths orbit [136]. The human data on the precise impact of cosmic radiation on the immune system is lacking, mostly due to the fact that there have not been enough manned missions outside of the Earths magnetic field. In vitro investigations show that the d0 (the mean lethal dose) values for various lymphocyte lineages range from 0.25-0.35 Gy [137]; by comparison, an average for mammalian oxygenated cells is around 1.5 Gy. Simulated cosmic radiation experiments performed on lymphocytes also indicate extensive chromosomal exchanges as a result of irradiation, the impact of which can be somewhat mitigated by shielding [138]. Data from animal model experiments performed on Earth is in accord with the above: in a rat experiment, whole-body 1 Gy irradiation produced an acute decrease in the concentration of circulating lymphocytes [139].",

          "text": "Overlap exists between the miRNA signatures in various cancers, age related miRNAs, and miRNAs associated with low-LET radiation, but little is reported on how all these factors uniformly impact cancer progression and effect cancer risk due to space radiation. Further, the impact of where and how the miRNAs affecting these factors (i.e. non-tumor related organs) is not understood. Although cosmic radiation risks include cataracts, circulatory disease, damage to CNS and others, risks of fatal cancer is the major component and contributor to overall radiation health risks that are being estimated and used for operation and planning of human space missions [183]. Due to the inherent paucity of human data on the space radiation effects on cancer and aging, and difficulties in recreating space radiation fields in the ground-based research studies to better characterize biological effectiveness of such radiation for cancer and aging related endpoints, current health risk estimates carry large uncertainties. It is therefore anticipated that cancer and aging will continue to play a dominant role in future studies to a) minimize the uncertainties to improve health risk management, b) to identify individual factors affecting radiation sensitivity and c) to generate sufficient knowledge for implementing various biotechnological countermeasures described in the next section.",

          "text": "Data from animal model experiments performed on Earth is in accord with the above: in a rat experiment, whole-body 1 Gy irradiation produced an acute decrease in the concentration of circulating lymphocytes [139]. Subsequent experiments simulating galactic cosmic irradiation and solar particle events on mice demonstrated both chronic and acute deleterious effects on lymphocyte populations, functioning and chromosomal stability, with circulating B lymphocytes being the most affected, followed by T-cells and natural killer cells (reviewed in [17] and also in [140]). In the context of radioprotection, previous studies investigated whether pre-exposure to radiation might have an impact on an individuals radiation sensitivity of the immune system. So far, different studies gave contradictory results [141] [142] [143] [144]. Therefore it is worthwhile to further investigate whether pre-exposure to low-dose radiation may offer some degree of radioprotection. The concept of DNA being the main target of ionizing radiation, combined with the classical views of molecular biology that DNA mutations are the main initiating and propagating events driving cellular neoplastic transformation and carcinogenesis [145], has led to the acceptance of the risk of fatal cancer as the major health risk of exposure to radiation [21].",

          "text": "The differentially expressed gene with the smallest adjusted p-value, Drd4 (adjusted p-value: 4.31E-51; log2 fold-change: 0.812), is a dopamine receptor that has been associated with the circadian rhythm. Specifically, Drd4 downregulates the gene Adcy113, which was also found to be differentially expressed in this study (adjusted p-value: 1.45E-09; log2 fold-change: 0.427). Adcy1 produces cyclic AMP, a signalling mechanism in numerous retinal functions, such as retinomotor movements, disc shedding, certain types of retinal degeneration, and apoptosis of photoreceptors5052. Circadian rhythm genes are of special interest in the space environment, where daynight light signals are irregular. For example, astronauts aboard the ISS will experience up to 16 sunsets and sunrises a day53. However, the mice in our experiment were in constant 12-h lightdark cycle, which leads us to believe that events other than the lightdark cycle itself are driving the changes in the circadian rhythm. Increased photoreceptor cone damage, reduced thickness of the retinal ONL, retinal INL, RPE, and choroid layers of the eye in the spaceflight group compared to ground control were reported in our study. Proton radiation-induced damage to the photoreceptor layer was also observed in our previous rodent study54. It is important to note that changes in global ocular structure and retinal layer thickness could have clinical andor pathological significance34.",

Despite surging interest in space travel in recent decades, the impacts of prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation.

          "text": "Differences in endocrine milieu in hypergravity treated dams may also be indicative of changes in the circadian system. Exposure to microgravity causes shifts in circadian rhythms and increases basal levels of cortisol in humans and rodents (Grigoriev et al., 1987; Dijk et al., 2001; Macho et al., 2001b; Macho et al., 2001a). Preflight circadian adaptation countermeasures revealed that altered lighting schedules during spaceflight caused phase shifts in plasma hormone rhythms; however, changes in basal cortisol levels were a result of alterations in gravity load (Czeisler et al., 1991; Whitson et al., 1995). Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that changes in basal cortisol due to changes in gravitational force are analogous, but distinct, from the circadian system mediated seasonal changes in hormone levels that are governed by changes in photoperiod length (Lincoln and Richardson, 1998; Dardente, 2007; Ebling and Barrett, 2008; Nakao et al., 2008), and may quite possibly be mediated through a hypothalmic-vestibular connection (Fuller et al., 2002; Murakami et al., 2002). Endogenous clocks enable organisms to anticipate periodic changes in the environment and to adapt their physiology accordingly. The transition from pregnancy to lactation represents a major physiological change requiring coordinated adjustments in physiology and metabolism to support milk production.",
