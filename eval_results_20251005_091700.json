      "answer": "Microgravity has significant effects on bone density in mice, as demonstrated by a study conducted on mice housed in the International Space Station for 2535 days. The research found that bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered when the mice were returned to a 1 g environment, indicating a strong relationship between gravitational loading and bone density recovery [1]. However, when exposed to 16 g (lunar gravity), the recovery was only partial, suggesting that higher gravitational forces do not fully mitigate the effects of microgravity on bone density [1].\n\nAdditionally, the study observed that both 1 g and 16 g conditions suppressed microgravity-induced changes in the expression of certain osteoblast and osteoclast marker genes, which are critical for bone formation and resorption [1]. This indicates that gravitational loading can influence the molecular mechanisms underlying bone density changes in response to microgravity. \n\nOverall, while microgravity leads to a reduction in bone density, the recovery process is more effective under 1 g compared to 16 g, highlighting the importance of gravitational conditions in the maintenance of bone health during long-duration spaceflight [1].",

      "answer": "Spaceflight has been shown to affect immune system function, primarily through mechanisms related to microgravity and stress responses. Research indicates that cosmic radiation can have adverse effects on the immune system at high doses (2 to 3 Gy), particularly during sporadic solar particle events, with the greatest exposure risk for astronauts engaged in extravehicular activities [1]. However, it is unlikely that flight mice in a low-Earth-orbit mission were exposed to such high radiation levels while protected by the space shuttle [1].\n\nIncreased systemic stress hormones, specifically spikes in urinary cortisol levels, have been documented around the time of space shuttle launch and landing [1]. Despite this, the impact of these acute stress responses on immune function during spaceflight remains unclear. The experimental design of a study allowed for in vivo antigen challenges to be delivered on flight days 6 and 10, which were remote from the acute neuroendocrine changes induced by launch and landing. This suggests that the acute stress responses likely had minimal effect on the measured immune responses [1].\n\nMoreover, the study highlighted that microgravity is the most likely spaceflight-related factor contributing to immune dysregulation, although the effects of cosmic radiation and systemic stress hormones cannot be entirely ruled out [1]. Long-term effects of short-duration spaceflight on the immune system are not well understood, particularly for civilians and first-time flyers. However, findings from short-duration space shuttle studies revealed decreased lymphocyte response, increased post-flight neutrophils, and decreased eosinophils, which correlated more with in-flight stress than with microgravity itself [1]. \n\nAdditionally, latent herpesvirus reactivation and cytomegalovirus shedding were observed during space shuttle flights, and similar adaptations were noted during International Space Station (ISS) missions, where crew members experienced mild infectious diseases and atypical allergies [1]. A 12-year comparison of immune data from ISS missions indicated improvements in immunity and reductions in stress and viral reactivation due to operational and biomedical countermeasures, suggesting that these measures may enhance the health and quality of life for astronauts during long-duration missions [1].",

It is very unlikely that flight mice in our study were exposed to these levels of radiation during a 15 d low-Earth-orbit mission while enclosed and protected by the space shuttle. Increased systemic stress hormones, as determine by spikes in urinary cortisol levels, have been documented immediately around the time of space shuttle launch and landing (35). However, how these changes in stress hormones may affect an immune response induced during the course of spaceflight remains unclear. Our current experiment was designed so that the in vivo antigen challenge was delivered on flight d 6 and 10 during a 15 d mission, remote from the acute neuroendocrine changes induced by launch and landing. As a result of this experimental design, the acute stress responses to launch and landing likely had minimal effect on the OVA-specific immune responses we measured. Although the possible effects of cosmic radiation and systemic stress hormones cannot be completely eliminated in our experiment, the most likely spaceflight-related factor that caused the immune dysregulation we observed remains to be microgravity.

          "text": "Finally, while the long-term effects of short-duration spaceflight on the immune system and the genome are minimally understood, particularly in civilians and first-fliers, these data are critical as we expand human presence in orbit and deep space. Additional studies are needed across varying cell types, mission duration, and crew background, which can also help guide countermeasures. Of note, the short-duration space shuttle studies revealed decreased lymphocyte response, post-flight neutrophil increase, and eosinophil decrease, correlating with in-flight stress rather than microgravity [28, 38, 39]. Latent herpesvirus reactivation and cytomegalovirus shedding were also observed during space shuttle flights [18]. Similar adaptations occurred during ISS missions, as crew members experienced mild infectious diseases, atypical allergies, or dermatitis without significant operational impact [18, 32], which seemed to be a function of mission duration. A 12-year ISS immune data comparison indicated improvements in immunity, stress, and viral reactivation due to operational and biomedical countermeasures onboard ISS, such as resupply frequency, improvements in personal communication, exercise equipment, and food quality and variety, suggesting the potential for improved quality of life on the health of astronauts [40].",

      "answer": "During space missions, significant changes in gene expression occur, particularly related to stress response and physiological adaptations. Research indicates that there is an increase in m6A mRNA modifications immediately following spaceflight, which are associated with gene markers linked to stress response [1]. This suggests that the unique conditions of spaceflight, such as microgravity and radiation exposure, may trigger specific molecular responses in astronauts.\n\nAdditionally, astronauts experience performance impairments across various activities after returning from space, necessitating reconditioning routines to regain their preflight performance levels [1]. These performance issues are likely influenced by substantial alterations in the circulatory and hematological systems during spaceflight, which occur at both molecular and physiological levels [1]. \n\nGround studies have attempted to characterize the impact of individual components of spaceflight on gene expression, focusing on factors like radiation and microgravity [1]. However, the available transcriptomic data from actual spaceflight exposure is limited, primarily focusing on a few specific assays, such as sequencing the human IgM repertoire and examining gene expression profiles from astronaut hair follicle samples [1]. \n\nTo further investigate these changes, a study involving eleven different biospecimen types was conducted on four civilian astronauts during the Inspiration4 mission, utilizing high-throughput sequencing methods [1]. This approach aimed to fill the knowledge gap regarding the transcriptome changes in astronauts, particularly in relation to RNA methylation and base modifications, which are critical for understanding the full scope of gene expression alterations during space missions [1].",

          "text": "Subject terms: RNA sequencing, Gene expression Here the authors explore the role of chemical modifications within RNA molecules in spaceflight response, observing increased m6A mRNA modifications immediately post-spaceflight in gene markers associated with stress response. Both short- and long-term missions into space are correlated with a variety of acute physiological effects, affecting diverse organ and cellular systems13. Astronauts generally experience performance impairment in a wide variety of activities post-spaceflight, requiring reconditioning routines to regain preflight performance4. Significant changes also occur within the circulatory and hematological system during spaceflight, on both a molecular and physiological level, which likely contributes to these effects5. Ground studies collecting transcriptomic profiles of human subjects have attempted to characterize the impact of individual components of spaceflight, such as radiation or microgravity exposure6,7, the latter being simulated with a parabolic flight8. With regard to direct spaceflight exposure, the available transcriptomic data is even more limited, focused on a few specific assays, either sequencing the human IgM repertoire following long-term spaceflight9, measuring the proteome of exhaled breath condensate after long-term spaceflight10, or examining gene expression profiles from astronaut hair follicle samples after long stays on the International Space Station11.",

However, beyond this limited work, there is scant data on the impact of human spaceflight on the transcriptome beyond the NASA Twins Study (1-year mission), and almost no data from short-duration missions. Moreover, there are no single-molecule, direct RNA datasets from astronauts, which can help detail changes in RNA methylation and base modifications while also capturing expression and isoform changes. To address this gap in transcriptome knowledge, eleven different biospecimen types underwent four types of high-throughput sequencing for each of the four civilian astronauts on the Inspiration4 (I4) mission12, including genomics, transcriptomics, immune profiles, microbiome, and some clinical blood tests13. Long read sequencing (LRS) technologies have potentially relevant clinical applications14, since they can capture both splicing and expression differences in full-length transcripts; nanopore long-read direct-RNA sequencing15 is additionally advantageous since it provides per-base epitranscriptomic data (e.g., m6A modification sites)16.",

          "text": "Additionally, future studies should expand the types of radiation exposure animals experience in order to fully capture the spectrum of radiation that bombards astronauts during spaceflight. The space radiation environment beyond LEO contains several types of ionizing radiation. Galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) with relatively high linear energy transfer (LET) and proton radiation due to solar particle events (SPEs) contribute a significant portion of the radiation dose accumulated by astronaut crew members [3]. High-energy heavy ions (HZE radiation) can produce distinct patterns of energy deposition in cells and tissues [13,35]. However, secondary particles produced by the interaction of SPE protons and heavy-charged GCR particles with the spacecraft structure include γ-rays and x-rays [3]. These radiation sources can also deliver a significant fraction of the total mission dose and pose a hazard to astronauts health [15]. For chronic irradiation exposure, we used flood sources consisting of plastic sheets embedded with the isotope 57Co that emits medium energy (122 and 136 keV) γ-rays. Additional research is needed to elucidate the CNS damage and readaptation response induced by the full spectrum of space radiation. In summary, a multitude of neurological effects and persistent brain transcriptional alterations were observed at 4 months post-HLULDR in 21-day exposures.",

Our study shows that the dose response data on space radiation obtained at the 1G condition could lead to the underestimation of astronauts potential risk for health deterioration, including cancer. This study also emphasizes the importance of obtaining data on the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under μG conditions. Keywords: lymphoblast, microgravity, space radiation, chromosome aberration Astronauts on deep-space missions will experience continual microgravity (μG) and uninterrupted doses of ionizing radiation higher than any exposure experienced in the history of human spaceflight. It is predicted that, during the 3-year human mission to Mars, astronauts will be simultaneously exposed to altered gravity and chronic radiation, with a cumulative effective radiation dose of about 1 sievert (Sv) [1]. The types of radiation were found in the space environment, such as galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE). The space radiation is more damaging to cells [2]. The biological impact of simulated space radiation on mammalian cells and rodents has been extensively investigated in ground-based experiments.",

      "answer": "Microgravity exposure leads to significant musculoskeletal alterations, particularly muscle atrophy, in both humans and rodent models. Research indicates that these changes are pronounced in females, who exhibit greater musculoskeletal aberrations compared to males during exposure to microgravity and partial-gravity environments. Notably, these differences in muscle atrophy are not influenced by the presence of sex steroid hormones [1].\n\nThe effects of microgravity on muscle strength are critical for the operational health and safety of astronauts. Skeletal muscle strength is essential for maintaining physical function during space missions, including those on the International Space Station (ISS) and future missions to the Moon and Mars [1]. The alterations caused by microgravity can lead to decreased muscle strength, which poses risks for astronauts' health and performance in space [1].\n\nTo counteract these effects, NASA has implemented strict exercise interventions on the ISS, requiring astronauts to engage in approximately two hours of exercise daily. However, these interventions have been found to be time-consuming and do not completely prevent the losses in muscle mass and strength associated with microgravity exposure [1]. Therefore, additional strategies may be necessary to effectively mitigate musculoskeletal loss, particularly for female astronauts, to ensure their occupational and overall health during long-duration space missions [1].",

      "answer": "Long-term spaceflight induces several cardiovascular changes, particularly in the context of heart adaptation and dysfunction. Studies indicate that after 30 days in space, the murine heart initiates an adaptive response to the space environment. This adaptation is evidenced by transcriptomic analyses, which revealed that out of 86,406 analyzed transcripts, only 1,147 (1.3%) were significant in the flight group, suggesting successful adaptation to the stressful conditions of spaceflight [1]. Key cellular processes involved in this adaptation include the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, GPCR signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway [1].\n\nIn contrast, research using a fly cardiac model aboard the International Space Station (ISS) demonstrates that exposure to microgravity can lead to heart dysfunction. Specifically, the hearts of these flies exhibited reduced contractility and alterations in genes and proteins that are crucial for maintaining heart structure and function [1]. This suggests that the cardiovascular system may respond negatively to microgravity, although the exact mechanisms and implications for human health remain unclear.\n\nWhile some early studies on astronauts who experienced microgravity for a few weeks to a few months did not reveal significant cardiac effects, there is limited clinical evidence regarding decreased function or the unmasking of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease [1]. Additionally, factors such as dehydration have been proposed as potential explanations for observed changes in cardiac function during short-term spaceflight [1]. Overall, the findings indicate a complex interplay between adaptation and dysfunction in the cardiovascular system during long-term exposure to microgravity, necessitating further research to fully understand these effects.",

          "text": "Additionally, our study was limited to the use of female mice. In humans, female astronauts suffer different cardiac effects compared to their male counterparts [60]. Studies planned for the future should be designed to include animals of both sexes in order to determine whether sex-based disparities occur in responses to the spaceflight environment. Sequential timepoint analyses would also be beneficial in order to provide insight regarding the ways in which the length of exposure to the spaceflight environment influences adaptive and reactive changes in the heart. Based on our findings, we propose that 30 days in spaceflight provides enough time for the initiation of an adaptive response to the space environment to occur within the murine heart. Out of 86,406 analyzed transcripts, only 1147 transcripts (1.3) were significant in the flight group, suggesting that by 30 days the heart has successfully adapted to the stressful space conditions. Some cellular processes that may contribute to adaptation and survival are the PI3K-Akt pathway, GPCR signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway.

          "text": "Walls et al. find that exposure to microgravity aboard the ISS causes heart dysfunction in a fly cardiac model. Hearts are less contractile and exhibit changes in genes and proteins that maintain heart structure and function. Effects are seen in several lines of flies, suggesting a common response to microgravity. Throughout history, humans have explored the earth, so much so, that few regions outside of the ocean depths still remain unexplored. This drive to go where no man has gone before, coupled with increasing pollution, climate change, and competition for scarcer resources, has brought humans to the point at which exploration and exploitation of other celestial bodies, such as the moon, asteroids, and other planets, is inevitable. However, our organ systems have evolved to work under 1g, and it is not clear what the effect of long-term exposure to lower gravity environments might be and how those effects are exerted at the cellular and molecular levels. Cardiac health has been a major concern of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for many years, but the clinical evidence for decreased function and unmasking of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease is limited. Early studies performed on astronauts who had been in microgravity for only a few weeks to a few months failed to uncover any cardiac effects (Hamilton et al., 2011), and some studies suggested that changes in function could be explained by dehydration (Summers et al., 2005).",

      "answer": "Cosmic radiation significantly impacts DNA damage and repair mechanisms within cells. Ionizing radiation, a component of cosmic radiation, can directly affect DNA by causing single-strand or double-strand breaks. Double-strand DNA breaks, particularly those resulting from close single hits or high-energy impacts, are notably more challenging for cells to repair. If these breaks are not properly rejoined, they can lead to cell death, while incorrectly rejoined breaks may result in mutations [1].\n\nThe effects of cosmic radiation on DNA are compounded by the nature of the radiation itself. Space radiation consists of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and protons trapped in the Van Allen radiation belt, all of which contribute to the overall exposure experienced during spaceflight [1]. The cumulative effect of even low-dose radiation over extended periods, such as during long-duration missions beyond low Earth orbit, raises concerns about the potential for increased carcinogenesis and other health risks [1].\n\nMoreover, DNA mutations induced by ionizing radiation can propagate onto RNA during the translation process unless they are effectively repaired by transcription-coupled repair mechanisms. Higher doses of radiation exposure correlate with greater accumulated damage, which can overwhelm cellular repair systems. In contrast, lower levels of damage may be replicated into RNA, leading to aberrant effects on translation and cellular function [1]. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data from mice liver samples indicated that there was no significant difference in overall mapping error rates across the genome, suggesting that while damage occurs, the cellular systems may still maintain a level of fidelity in RNA processing [1]. \n\nIn summary, cosmic radiation poses a significant risk to DNA integrity through direct damage and challenges to repair mechanisms, with implications for cellular function and long-term health in space environments.",

          "text": "Ionizing radiation can impact the cells directly, where the particles impact a vital target molecule and directly transfer their energy, or indirectly, where particles impact other molecules, such as water, leading to longer lasting, very reactive free radicals. When impacting DNA, ionizing radiation can cause single-strand or double-strand DNA breaks. Double-strand DNA breaks, especially those caused by close single hits or high-energy hits, are much harder to repair. Non-rejoined breaks can lead to cell death, while incorrectly rejoined breaks can lead to mutation. Space radiation has a complex impact on human tissues and is an etiological agent for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system impairment, radiation sickness, and other harmful conditions [3,13]. The Earths magnetic field is a crucial protective element. Given the nature of ionizing space radiation, an increased rate of carcinogenesis is a primary concern for long-duration spaceflight [14]. While no increase in gynecologic cancer risk has yet been revealed in the female astronaut population [15,16], as exploration missions will be outside of low Earth orbit and for increasingly long durations, concern remains regarding the effects of even a low-dose rate accumulating over time [17]. The three main sources of ionizing space radiation are galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and the Van Allen radiation belt [18].",

The provenance of data from GLDS-111 (Bion-M1) is detailed in the environmental data section of the GLDS for Bion-M1. The doses and dose rates for ground-based exposures are from the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory with uncertainties that are less than 2 [24]. Summary of the NASA GeneLab datasets for samples exposed to cosmic radiation during spaceflight or analogous ground-based radiation experiments curated for analysis.  LEO: low Earth orbit radiation for flight experiments is due to a combination of cosmic radiation (protons, galactic cosmic rays (GCR), and heavier ions) as well as protons trapped in Earth radiation belts. DNA mutations caused by ionizing radiation have been shown to propagate onto RNA during translation, unless they are adequately removed by transcription-coupled repair. Higher doses of radiation exposure to a cell will result in greater accumulated damage, up to a point where the cellular repair mechanisms are overwhelmed. However, lower levels of damage may be replicated into RNA with aberrant effects on translation and cellular function. Thus, RNA-sequencing data using mice liver samples from two experiments were analyzed to identify potential error rates due to spaceflight. Analysis of the GLDS-168 dataset showed no difference in overall mapping error rates across the entire genome (approximately 0.5).",

          "text": "Human spaceflight exposes individuals and their immune systems to unique environmental factors, including microgravity, fluid shifts, and radiation1,2. Since 1961, over 675 astronauts have traveled to space; studies on some crew members have shown significant immune stress related to spaceflight3. Given that more individuals with diverse physical and biomedical backgrounds are traveling into spaceand that many more commercial missions are planned (e.g., Polaris Dawn, Axiom)an urgent goal of aerospace medicine is to understand better how the immune system responds to and recovers from spaceflight for the broader civilian population. Moreover, such profiles of cellular and molecular changes in commercial crews can guide personalized countermeasures for the missions and eventually lead to better crew performance and safety4. Immune-related clinical symptoms from spaceflight are prevalent among astronauts and span many phenotypes, including inflammation, infection, and viral reactivation5,6. Indeed, clinical symptoms associated with immune dysregulation were reported with 3.4 events per flight year, representing 46 of crew members6. While these findings show that the spaceflight environment affects the human immune system, they do not reveal the underlying pathways and mechanisms therein, underscoring the need for further studies.

It is very unlikely that flight mice in our study were exposed to these levels of radiation during a 15 d low-Earth-orbit mission while enclosed and protected by the space shuttle. Increased systemic stress hormones, as determine by spikes in urinary cortisol levels, have been documented immediately around the time of space shuttle launch and landing (35). However, how these changes in stress hormones may affect an immune response induced during the course of spaceflight remains unclear. Our current experiment was designed so that the in vivo antigen challenge was delivered on flight d 6 and 10 during a 15 d mission, remote from the acute neuroendocrine changes induced by launch and landing. As a result of this experimental design, the acute stress responses to launch and landing likely had minimal effect on the OVA-specific immune responses we measured. Although the possible effects of cosmic radiation and systemic stress hormones cannot be completely eliminated in our experiment, the most likely spaceflight-related factor that caused the immune dysregulation we observed remains to be microgravity.

      "answer": "Microgravity significantly influences stem cell differentiation by suppressing the differentiation processes of certain stem cells, particularly human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Studies indicate that when hMSCs are cultured in a microgravity environment, they tend to retain their undifferentiated phenotypes, which suggests that the absence of gravitational forces can help maintain their functional characteristics [1][38]. This phenomenon occurs because microgravity conditions may alter the mechanical environment that typically influences stem cell behavior, leading to reduced differentiation [1].\n\nIn addition to the suppression of differentiation, microgravity also affects stem cell proliferation. Research has shown that the unique conditions of microgravity can modulate intrinsic factors within the tissue mechanical environment, resulting in reduced mechanical loads that stem cells experience [1][8]. This reduction in mechanical stress may contribute to the maintenance of stem cell characteristics, as traditional static cell culture methods often apply pressure loading that is below physiologically relevant levels [1][9]. \n\nMoreover, while various strategies have been employed to simulate microgravity on Earth, such as cyclic stretch and hydrostatic pressure, these methods often introduce non-physiologic fluid shear and rotational loading, which can further complicate the understanding of stem cell behavior under true microgravity conditions [1][9]. Therefore, the evidence suggests that microgravity not only preserves the undifferentiated state of stem cells but also creates a unique environment that may enhance their potential for proliferation and functional maintenance [1][38].",

          "text": "Among possible sources of stress, gravity may historically have been the most underappreciated microenvironment stress, because of its constant influence on cultured cells. Numerous studies have reported the impact of microgravity conditions on stem-cell proliferation [35] and differentiation [36,37]. Notably, human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in a microgravity environment usually demonstrate suppressed differentiation [38]. Therefore, some highly functional stem cells may be able to retain their undifferentiated, unaltered phenotypes if they can avoid the force of gravity during culture. According to previous studies, controlled rotation around two axes can minimize the cumulative gravity vector to an average of 103 g over time [24]. In our experimental system, although cells were attached to microsphere surfaces, the culture medium containing the microspheres was stirred by controlled rotation around two axes. As a result, the cells gravity vectors were randomly and continuously changing, with their final cumulative gravity vectors being minimized toward zero. Some microgravity-simulating devices have been developed [39,40], but they involve significant costs and are very difficult to standardize. Moreover, even such devices created large cell clusters which represent the limit of cell-proliferative capacity [25] and reinforce the advantage of the present adhesive conditions for the large-scale expansion of hASCs [41].",

          "text": "To simulate physiologically relevant ranges of mechanical loads in cell cultures, various strategies have been used including applying cyclic stretch [5], or pulses of hydrostatic pressure [6], and hypergravity (HG) [7], that often result in enhanced cellular proliferation and differentiation effects. In the unique environment of space, free fall-induced weightlessness can modulate the intrinsic factors of tissue mechanical environment leading to reduced mechanical loads in tissue niche environments [8]. Modeling the effects of microgravity on Earth has been attempted with a multitude of strategies; however, many of these strategies in an effort to replicate free fall, generate non-physiologic fluid shear and rotational loading to the cells [9]. The interesting observation that traditional static cell culture plating results in pressure loading well below the physiologically relevant range may provide a unique path for cellular level modeling of the microgravity free fall environment. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are primary stem cells that can be turned toward specific fates by exclusive modulation of mechanical environment [10,11]. However, these methods often induce ESC differentiation to a single cell type, removing the cultures from physiologic relevance.",

      "answer": "Prolonged space missions have significant neurological effects, particularly on the central nervous system (CNS). Research indicates that exposure to microgravity leads to severe abnormalities in the CNS of various species, including Drosophila and Mus musculus. For instance, Drosophila studies aboard the International Space Station (ISS) revealed that while behavioral activity increased during microgravity, postflight analyses showed significant climbing defects, indicating a sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity conditions [1]. \n\nIn Mus musculus, neuroinflammation has been observed following exposure to ionizing radiation, either alone or in combination with microgravity [1]. A study by Santucci et al. found that after a three-month mission on the ISS, the expression of nerve growth factor (Ngf) decreased in the hippocampus, cortex, and adrenal gland under spaceflight conditions. In contrast, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) did not show consistent changes across brain regions [1]. These proteins are crucial for learning and memory, as they regulate neural plasticity, suggesting that prolonged space missions may impair cognitive functions.\n\nMoreover, alterations in gene expression related to metabolic and catabolic processes were noted, with downregulation of certain genes and upregulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial function, calcium metabolism, ATP synthesis, and amino acid transportation [1]. This indicates that prolonged exposure to microgravity can disrupt normal cellular functions in the brain, potentially leading to long-term neurological deficits.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that prolonged space missions can lead to significant neurological changes, including neuronal loss, oxidative damage, and alterations in glial cell counts, particularly in microgravity conditions [1]. While artificial gravity may provide some protective effects, the full extent of these neurological impacts requires further investigation to understand the long-term implications for astronauts' health during extended missions.",

We report CNS changes in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to microgravity (SFμg) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) via inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SFμg exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress, and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFμg and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFμg. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFμg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight.

Both proteins are involved in learning and memory via regulating neural plasticity. Genes related to various metabolic and catabolic processes were downregulated as well, while proteins related to mitochondrial and calcium metabolism, synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP, and amino acid transportation were upregulated14. Frigeri et al. (OSD-32, 10.26030jpyz-fn46) performed mRNA expression analysis in brain tissue of mice that were hindlimb-unloaded for 2 weeks.

      "answer": "Weightlessness significantly affects bone remodeling in astronauts, primarily through alterations in bone mineral content and cellular dynamics. During long-duration spaceflight, the absence of gravity leads to a reduction in mechano-stimulation, which is crucial for the proliferation and differentiation of tissue-specific adult stem cells involved in bone maintenance [1]. This disruption can result in serious health consequences, particularly for bone tissue, where short-duration exposure to microgravity has been shown to cause rapid changes in bone mineral content and gene expression patterns [1].\n\nSpecifically, astronauts experience an approximate 12% loss of skeletal mineral in weight-bearing bones per month while in microgravity [1]. This accelerated bone loss is attributed to an uncoupling of the processes of bone resorption and formation. In microgravity, there is an increase in osteoclast activity, which enhances bone resorption, while osteoblast activity, responsible for bone formation, decreases [1]. Increased osteoclast bone resorptive activity has been documented within the first several days of spaceflight, indicating that the effects of microgravity on bone remodeling can occur rapidly [1].\n\nPre- and post-flight measurements of bone density in astronauts have quantified an overall bone loss rate of approximately 11.5% per month, with the lumbar spine, pelvis, and lower limbs being the most affected areas [1]. Additionally, measurements of volumetric bone mineral density in astronaut tibias after spaceflight revealed a 5% reduction, which is comparable to the average bone loss seen in men over twenty years and is six times faster than the accelerated bone loss typically observed in menopausal women [1]. These findings underscore the importance of addressing bone loss as a high priority for astronaut health and safety during space missions.",

          "text": "Since normal tissue repair and regeneration is dependent on the ability of adult stem cells to proliferate and differentiate, we have hypothesized that during long-term spaceflight, the reduction in gravity mechano-stimulation may decrease regenerative proliferation and differentiation of tissue-specific adult stem cells. This in turn may have significant health consequences for multiple tissues throughout the body, including bone. Specifically for bone tissue, short-duration exposure to microgravity rapidly leads to alterations in bone mineral content, cellular dynamics, and gene expression patterns [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. This is illustrated by a 12 loss of skeletal mineral in weight-bearing bones per month [17], which poses significant risks for long-duration and interplanetary missions. Because bone remodeling homeostasis depends on tightly coupled mineral deposition and resorption [20], [21], uncoupling of these processes in microgravity can cause increased and rapid bone resorption by osteoclasts, and decreased bone formation by osteoblasts [17], [18], [22], [23]. Increased osteoclast bone resorptive activity has been documented within the first several days of spaceflight [1], [17] and may be reduced after a period of transition and adaptation to microgravity.",

          "text": "It is therefore vital to continually monitor microbial pathogenesis on the ISS to avoid crew member infections and continue studying the built environment for optimization for future space travel. Astronaut bone loss during space flight has been an unresolved medical concern since the 1970s. Pre- and post-flight measurements of bone density in astronauts quantified with absorptiometry and quantitative computed tomography have shown an overall bone loss rate of 11.5 per month with areas of the lumbar spine, pelvis, and lower limbs contributing most heavily to the decline in bone density (Figure 2) [340,341,342,343,344,345]. Measurements of volumetric bone mineral density in astronaut tibias after spaceflight showed a 5-percentile reduction that is comparable to average bone loss occurring in men over twenty years and 6 times faster than the accelerated bone loss that is often seen in menopausal women [346]. These findings have made bone loss treatment and prevention a high priority for astronaut health and safety. Bones undergo modeling during development and remodeling in later stages of life to form, replace, and remove bone [347]. Osteoblasts are derived from stromal cells of the bone marrow and are responsible for bone formation [348].",

Additional research on the specific alterations in protein expression due to spaceflight conditions would be needed. However, it is noted that plants exhibit significant changes in gene expression as part of their physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment [1]. \n\nWhile the context mentions that studies on plant adaptation at the proteomic level have been limited, it highlights that the only comprehensive proteomic-scale study conducted involved a label-free analysis of membrane proteins from Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the International Space Station (ISS) [1]. This suggests that while gene expression changes are well-documented, the understanding of protein expression changes remains less explored.\n\nFurthermore, the use of comparative proteomics mass spectrometry (MS) methods, such as iTRAQ (isotope tags for relative and absolute quantification), allows for quantitative comparisons of protein changes in samples [1]. This method has been effectively applied in studies of Arabidopsis to analyze broad-scale proteomic changes, indicating that there is potential for future research to elucidate the specific protein expression changes that occur in space-exposed organisms [1]. \n\nIn summary, while significant gene expression changes are established in plants exposed to spaceflight, detailed insights into protein expression changes are still emerging, and further studies are necessary to fully understand these adaptations.",

          "text": "Although there is little specific overlap with transcriptome studies of plants exposed to similar environments, many of the trends in pathways affected by spaceflight are similar among the studies (Moseyko et al., 2002; Tan et al., 2011). With increased technical sensitivity and better access to space, the spaceflight responses contribute to a comprehensive picture of the strategies used by plants to cope with changes in their environment. Comparative proteomics mass spectrometry (MS) methods can be used to reveal quantitative changes in the protein complement of cells and organs over a large scale between and among samples. The use of iTRAQ (isotope tags for relative and absolute quantification; Applied Biosystems) allows for quantitative comparisons of samples by labeling lysine residues and N-termini of peptides with mass reporter molecules, such that the samples can be combined into simultaneous analyses by MS. The relative amounts of every identified peptide from each sample are simultaneously revealed within the tandem mass spectra through the relative intensity of the differentially labeled ion peaks, enabling each peptide to be correlated to each sample through the mass of the reporter molecules. Several papers have demonstrated the effectiveness of iTRAQ analysis of Arabidopsis samples in the study of broad-scale proteomic changes (Zhao et al., 2010; Alvarez et al., 2011; Schenck et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014).",

          "text": "Key Words: Space biologyProteomicsGene expressionISS. Astrobiology 15, 3256. Plants undergo substantial physiological adaptation to accommodate changing environments. As sessile organisms, plants have developed exquisitely sensitive metabolisms that can provide insights into how eukaryotes sense and respond to external stimuli. Spaceflight presents unique challenges to terrestrial organisms. The microgravity environment in itself is outside the evolutionary experience of any terrestrial organism, but the absence of gravity also impacts the physical environment inherent to the unique living space of orbital vehicles (Musgrave et al., 1997; Wolff et al., 2013). It is now well established that plants grown in orbital vehicles exhibit significant changes in gene expression as part of the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment (Link et al., 2001; Paul et al., 2001, 2005, 2012b, 2013; Stutte et al., 2006; Salmi and Roux, 2008; Salmi et al., 2011; Correll et al., 2013; Nasir et al., 2014; Sugimoto et al., 2014). However, studies approaching plant adaptation to spaceflight at the level of the proteome have been limited. To date, the only true proteomic-scale study of plants in space has been a label-free analysis of membrane proteins isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the International Space Station (ISS) (Mazars et al., 2014).",

      "answer": "Microgravity impacts mitochondrial function by enhancing mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in oligodendrocytes. A study reported that after 24 hours of exposure to simulated microgravity (sim-μG), there was an increase in both mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in these cells, which are crucial for energy production in the central nervous system [1]. \n\nAdditionally, the examination of the secretome after three days of exposure to sim-μG revealed increased activity in the Krebs cycle, indicating a significant alteration in metabolic pathways under microgravity conditions [1]. This suggests that microgravity not only affects mitochondrial respiration but also influences broader metabolic processes, potentially leading to changes in energy utilization and lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes [1].\n\nIn contrast, other studies have shown that microgravity can lead to downregulation of mitochondrial function pathways in different cell types, such as muscle cells. For instance, research involving muscle biopsies from healthy young men indicated that bedrest, simulating microgravity conditions, resulted in decreased mitochondrial function and increased insulin resistance [2]. This highlights a complex relationship where microgravity can both enhance and impair mitochondrial function depending on the cell type and specific conditions studied.\n\nOverall, while there is evidence of enhanced mitochondrial function in oligodendrocytes under simulated microgravity, other cell types may experience detrimental effects, indicating that the impact of microgravity on mitochondrial function is context-dependent [1][2].",

Here we sought to determine how simulated microgravity (sim-μG) impacts both energy and lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis 24 hours after exposure to sim-μG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after three days exposure of OLs to sim-μG confirmed increased the Krebs cycle (Krebs  Weitzman et al.",

They confirmed downregulation of mitochondrial function pathways and increased muscle insulin resistance induced by bedrest conditions, which were only partially recovered after muscle retraining42. In addition, several studies have aimed to determine how human bone marrow stem cells react and differentiate in altered gravitational conditions. Mayer-Wagner et al. (OSD-124, 10.260306fwd-2p79) studied how chondrogenesis is affected during simulated reduced gravity and low-frequency electromagnetic fields, concluding that microgravity conditions significantly downregulated COLXA1, COL2A1, and aggrecan, representing decreased chondrogenic potential43. Bradamante et al. (OSD-546, 10.26030mg6a-qv31) examined the effects in terms of growth and differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) housed on the ISS for 2 weeks. They identified upregulation of genes that are related to osteogenesis (BGLAP, CHRDL1, and SPP1) and metabolism of steroid hormones and vitamins A, D pathway (CYP19A1, CYP24A1, AKR1B1, HSD11B1). Cell proliferation, motility and cell-cell communication seemed also to be affected as evidenced by downregulation of CSNK2A2, ITGAV, NRCAM, and NRP2, while the RAB27b gene associated with microvesicle formation was significantly upregulated.",

          "text": "The types of radiation were found in the space environment, such as galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE). The space radiation is more damaging to cells [2]. The biological impact of simulated space radiation on mammalian cells and rodents has been extensively investigated in ground-based experiments. Such studies have shown that space radiation not only has higher cancer risk [3,4], but also negatively affects the function of the cardiovascular [5,6], central nervous [7,8] and immune [9,10,11] systems. The effects of μG on mammalian cells have been studied extensively on the International Space Station (ISS), or by using clinostats for ground-based experiments. It is well known that μG affects various cellular functions such as altered cell adherence, protein expression, gene expression, morphology, increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation rates [12,13,14,15]. In space biology studies, there is a basic question; what is the effect of exposing cells simultaneously to μG and space radiation? The answer to this question has significant implications on the astronauts health risk assessment and management during long-term space missions. There are many investigations about the combined effects of space radiation and μG, carried out both in space and on the ground (see the review by Moreno-Villanueva et al.) [16]. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus. Some reported synergy (i.e., increased detrimental effects), but some did not.",
